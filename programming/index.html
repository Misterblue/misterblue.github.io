There are several programming projects I'm playing with.
This makes for a hodge-podge of links and I don't always take
the time to make cleanly installable packages.
Not good of me, I know.

If you have questions, feel free to email me.

## OpenSimulator (August 2014 to current)

I've been a core developer for
<a href="http://opensimulator.org">OpenSimulator</a>
and have added
<a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/BulletSim">BulletSim</a>
which is a port of the
<a href="http://bulletphysics.org">Bullet physics engine</a>
to the OpenSimulator virtual world simulator.

I've also added variable sized regions
<a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Varregion">VarRegions</a>
which are non-legacy sized regions (not 256x256).

## LookingGlass (July 2009)

            alt="LookingGlass Viewer Logo" />

Getting involved in C# and the
<a href="http://opensimulator.org">OpenSimulator</a>
project, I set about writing a viewer. This got me
into <a href="http://ogre3d.org">Ogre</a>,
C# and many other pieces of code.

The LookingGlass viewer now has it's own web site at
<a href="http://lookingglassviewer.org">http://lookingglassviewer.org</a>
and the sources are available in the
<a href="http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/lookingglass">
OpenSimulator Project Forge</a>.
That place also collects bugs, features and other project management.

Dynamic loading of resources in Ogre is an artform.
After wrestling with it for several weeks, 
I wrote up my solution in
<a href="http://misterblue.com/programming/dynamic-ogre-resources">
Dynamic Loading of Ogre Resources</a>.

## PlanetLab (March 2008)

<a href="http://www.planet-lab.org/">PlanetLab</a>
is a global research platform for distributed service research.
Once part of the network (universities and companies join
by donating computers to the network), once can create
virtual machines all over the world to develop and test
new concepts in wildly distributed applications.

I wrote two and run one service on PlanetLab:
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>
            <a href="http://dsmt.org/">
                Distributed Services Management Toolkit
            </a>
        </strong>
        : which manages the creation of virtual machines and
        the installation of services on PlanetLab nodes.
        There is a
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dsmt">
            SourceForge project
        </a>
        to support the sources and bug reports and a
        <a href="http://dsmt.org/">web site</a>
        with documentation and status.
        <strong>THIS SERVICE IS NOT OPERATIONAL</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            <a href="http://psepr.org/">
                Planetary Scale Event Propagation and Routing
            </a>
        </strong>
        : which is a publish/subscribe, XML eventing system.
        Built for pluggable routing implementations
        (it's a research platform after all) is currently
        provides a simple 'channel' subscription mechanism.
        There is a
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/psepr">
            SourceForge project
        </a>
        to support the sources and bug reports and a
        <a href="http://psepr.org/">web site</a>
        with documentation and status.
    </li>
</ul>
