There are several programming projects I'm playing with.
This makes for a hodge-podge of links and I don't always take
the time to make cleanly installable packages.
Not good of me, I know.

    <h1>Helping with Crystal-Frost Viewer (2023 to current)</h1>
    <p>
        There are several OpenSimulator/Second Life viewer development efforts.
        In 2023, I added configuration code and a bunch of refactoring help to the
        Crystal-Frost Viewer
        effort.
        This is a viewer that is using the
        <a href="https://github.com/cinderblocks/libremetaverse">libreMetaverse library</a>
        and the
        <a href="https://unity.com/products/unity-engine">Unity graphics engine</a>
        .
    </p>
    <p>
        This work also included
        <a href="https://github.com/cinderblocks/libremetaverse/pull/85">adding</a>
        <a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Varregion">VarRegion</a>
        support to
        <a href="https://github.com/cinderblocks/libremetaverse">libreMetaverse</a>
        .
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the project doesn't have a public web page or repository,
        the viewer has been mentioned in 
        <a href="https://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2023/03/water-physics-crystal-frost-unity-sl-viewer-download.html">New World Notes</a>

    <h1>Another Take on Basil Virtual World Viewer (2022)</h1>
    <p>
        Not content at letting
        Basil
        lie dormant, I restarted coding and got it to a point where one
        could log into properly compiled
        <a href="https://osgrid.org">OSGrid</a>
        region and walk around as a ducky.
    </p>
    <p>
        This phase ended with a

    <h1>Metaverse Server for HiFi Dispora (2021/2022)</h1>
    <p>
        I wrote a new grid server for the High Fidelity open sourced virtual worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the company
        High Fidelity
        got out of the virtual world business, they open sourced
        their client and some infrastructure.
        Several projects took up the sources and continued the development
        and deployment of the software infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing High Fidelity didn't open source was the metaverse service
        which coordinates the region servers, user accounts, and such.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2021, I reverse-engineered the API for the grid service and wrote a
        new grid service for the
        <a href="https://vircadia.com">Vircadia</a>
        virtual world system.
        This meant diving into Javascript and Typescript to write an API
        service for the HiFi based virtual world grids. Data was stored
        in MongoDB as I'd never used that database system before.
    </p>
    <p>
        Modified versions of this grid service are now used by 
        <a href="https://vircadia.com">Vircadia</a>
        as well as the
        <a href="https://overte.org">Overte</a>
        virtual world grids.
        Vircadia has made many improvements to the
        <a href="https://github.com/vircadia/vircadia-metaverse">metaverse server</a>
        since then.

    <h1>Yet Another Virtual World Viewer</h1>
    <p>
        I've spent some time playing with the idea of a single infrastructure
        for augmented reality and virtual worlds.
        There is an
        <a href="http://blog.misterblue.com/virtualworlds/herbal3d/">architectural overview</a>
        for 
        <a href="http://blog.misterblue.com/virtualworlds/herbal3d/">Herbal3D</a>
        .
    </p>
    <p>
        My current attempt at a 3D virtual world viewer is
        <a href="http://blog.misterblue.com/basil/">Basil</a> which is an architecture around creating
        a viewer where a
        <a href="https://vircadia.com/">Vircadia</a>
        avatar can stand next to an
        <a href="http://opensimulator.org">OpenSimulator</a>
        avatar.
    </p>
    <p>
        I tried with the Looking Glass viewer (see
        <a href="http://lookingglassviewer.org">http://lookingglassviewer.org</a>
        )
        but I never gave up on the idea of a viewer for
        virtual worlds.
        The documentation for Basil is scattered around with some
        on my 
        <a href="http://blog.misterblue.com/basil/">blog</a>,
        some with the projects on Github,
        and some covering the larger
        <a href="http://blog.misterblue.com/virtualworlds/herbal3d/">Herbal3D</a>
        project of which Basil is just a part.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the moment (February 2022), the focus is on a WebGL based viewer
        and building the infrastructure to view
        <a href="http://opensimulator.org/">OpenSimulator</a> virtual worlds.
        Eventually, there will be an
        <a herf="https://www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal Engine</a>
        version of the viewer and adaptors for other virtual worlds.

        I've been a core developer for

    <p>
        I've also added variable sized regions

        Getting involved in C# and the
        <a href="http://opensimulator.org">OpenSimulator</a>
        project, I set about writing a viewer. This got me
        into <a href="http://ogre3d.org">Ogre</a>,
        C# and many other pieces of code.
    </p>
    <p>
        The LookingGlass viewer now has it's own web site at
        <a href="http://lookingglassviewer.org">http://lookingglassviewer.org</a>
        and the sources are available in the
        <a href="http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/lookingglass">
        OpenSimulator Project Forge</a>.
        That place also collects bugs, features and other project management.

        Dynamic loading of resources in Ogre is an artform.
        After wrestling with it for several weeks, 
        I wrote up my solution in
