# Authentication/Authorization Handling for Basil

Basil does not handle authentication (logging in a user) and it only handles
authorization to access resources by passing around bearer tokens -- tokens
are given to Basil who passes them to resource servers.

Most of the bearer tokens used are [JWT] encoded tokens.

Basil is invoked with a Base64 encoded JSON string. This string includes an 'auth'
section which contains at least:

```javascript
{
    'auth': {
        'SessionKey': '01234567890123456789',
        'UserAuth': '012345678901234567890123456789'
    }
}
```

where `SessionKey` is a string that uniquely identifies this Basil session
and `UserAuth` is a token from the authentication service that Basil can
pass in server to authenticate the user and request a session.

Both of these strings come from the authentication service and their interpretation
and representation is opaque to Basil.

The JSON encoded invocation parameter string also includes a `comm` section which
gives the URL and service type for Basil to connect to. If the service is a
SpaceServer, Basil will do a `SpaceServer.OpenConnection()` request. The "Auth" parameter
passed in the `SpaceServer.OpenConnection()` request will have the contents:

```javascript
{
    'accessProperties': {
        'SessionKey': '01234567890123456789',
        'UserAuth': '012345678901234567890123456789',
        'ClientAuth': '012345678900123456789'
    }
}
```

where `SessionKey` and `UserAuth` contain the values passed to Basil by the
authentication service, and `ClientAuth` is an authentication token generated by
Basil an passed to the SpaceServer. The SpaceServer will return this value when
making requests to the BasilServer to verify the request source.

The `SpaceServer.OpenSession()` request, if successful, returns properties that
point to asset services and tokens authorizing access to those services.
The properties are coded as:

```javascript
{
    'SessionKey': '01234567890123456789',
    'SessionAuth': '98765432109876543210987654321',
    'SessionAuthExpiration': 'date',
    'Services': '[ { "Name": "ServiceName", "Url": "ServiceURL", "Auth": "989898", "AuthExpiration": "date" } ]'
}
```

where `SessionKey` is a replay of `SessionKey` from the invocation,
`SessionAuth` is a new authorization token that Basil will return in future
SpaceServer requests to authorize access,
`SessinAuthExpiration` is the date when the `SessionAuth` token will expire.

`Services` is a JSON encoded string containing an array of one or more services that Basil
may need to access for this session. For each service, if an authorization token is needed,
it is supplied in an `Auth` and `AuthExpiration` value.


Authorization expiration dates are [RFC3339] date strings.
