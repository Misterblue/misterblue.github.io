The reason I wasn't here to fix my server when it went down was that I
was spending the weekend in 
<a href="http://www.ci.des-moines.ia.us/">Des Moines, Iowa</a>
 for the
<a href="http://www.desmoinesmarathon.com/">Des Moines Marathon</a>
.
I was going to run the half marathon but the real reason for being there
was supporting my
<a href="http://wyvernrunning.com/">wife's business</a>
at the marathon expo.
Many sunglasses and
<a href="http://www.sheddableshell.com/">Sheddable Shells</a>
were sold because it was just the beginning of winter in Des Moines
and there was just a chance of snow and temperatures in the 30s
with lots of sunshine and wind.
</p>
<p>
I grew up in Portland, Oregon and have watched it change from a metro size
of 500,000 to it's current two million.  That changes a city.
Des Moines is still a small town with 500,000 in the metro area.  Downtown is not crowded (on Friday I had assumed it was Sunday because of the traffic downtown)
and the people are friendly and close knit.
The whole town turns out for a city event.
There was not much new building downtown and there was a lot of office
space for lease.
What building was happening was a stadium (state/city money), the interstate through the city (federal money)
and a new
Science Museum of Iowa (state/federal money).
If it wasn't for the government borrowing money like an insane person,
there'd be nothing happening.
Other than that, all in all a pleasant town.
