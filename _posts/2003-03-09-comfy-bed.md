<p>
I mentioned staying in bed this morning. 
I like my comfortable bed -- spendy matress and 400 count sheets make a comfortable place to lie and read.

What I aspire to is a
<a href="http://www.starwood.com/westin/service/reservations_service.html">Heavenly Bed</a>
found at the
<a href="">Westin Hotels</a>
<a href="http://www.starwood.com/westin/service/reservations_service.html">Heavenly Bed</a>.
They offer to sell them, but I can't go for the $2,500.
