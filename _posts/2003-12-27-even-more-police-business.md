</li>
<li>
A suspicious vehicle seen driving in circles at the High School was determined to be a father teaching his son to drive a stick shift.
</li>
<li>
A man wo bought copper kettles in Jordan called police wen something fell off them -- drugs, he suspected.
Police tested the mystery crud fr opiates and THC, and still don't know what it is.
</li>
<li>
When he ran a stop sign, she threw her gloves at him.
When he stopped to confront her, he threw her hand truck over an embankment, climbed back in his truck and left.
</li>
<li>
A woman said her night vision glasses enabled her to spot her ex-boyfriend walking around her home.
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
Cape-draped, sword carrying juveniles were reported standing in the traffic lanes in front of the Lake Theatre.
Police found the group waiting to see "The Lord or the Rings" and told them to stay out of the street.
</li>
</ul>
