  content: Wow, nice picture of the guys and their fresh "kill".  I would like to report that the colorado blue spruce indeed kept the kitten from inside the tree, however, she did like to "undecorate" everything within her "godzilla kitty" reach.

<p>
We went out last Sunday and cut our own Christmas tree and set it up for the
10th anniversary of
<a href="http://christmascam.us/">ChristmasCam</a>.
This year we didn't get the normal Douglas Fir.
We got a Colorado Spruce.
We read somewhere that this is a prickily tree that cats might not try to
climb.
We happen to have a hyperactive kitten in the house this year, so
non-climbing is a good thing.
I will report that the tree is Very Prickily.
Gloves are required for any handling.
I'll report on my luck with the kitten.
