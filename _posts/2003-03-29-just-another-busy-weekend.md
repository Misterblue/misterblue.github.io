Another weekend filled with chores and stuff.  You would think that after a week of work, one could have the weekend off, but, &lt;SteveMartinVoice&gt;nnnnnnoooooooo&lt;/SteveMartinVoice&gt; the weekend fills up with all the stuff one has to do around the house and that couldn't be done while you were working.
</p>
<p>
Let's see,  we start with a 3 mile run with our
<a href="http://www.portlandmarathon.org">Portland Marathon</a>
<a href="http://www.portlandfit.com">training group</a>,
the kids have a
<a href="http://www.metroyouthsymphony.org">concert and orchestra rehearsal</a>
and tonight, the wife and I have a
<a href="http://www.lakewood-center.org/theater/current_season.htm">play</a> 
to go to.
Tomorrow, I get to finish my
<a href="http://www.irs.gov/">taxes</a>
, move the house phone line so it's out of the way for the contractor on Monday (with the necessary trip to
<a href="http://www.frys.com/">Frys</a>
),
pick up more of the house because of the mess of the remodel.
</p>
<p>
Sigh. That doesn't leave me much time to work on this web site, the
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com">picture pages</a>
(fun with
<a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSLT</a>
) and writing more stuff here.  Maybe next weekend.
