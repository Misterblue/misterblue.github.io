The place where I work has an enclosed courtyard in between two of the buildings.
Normally, once can have lunch out in the sun.
But, every now and then, the birds move in.
This is not like a Hitchcock movie.  This is more like a nursery.
</p>
<p>
Each year there are ducks that move in to have some ducklings.
While this is going on, the courtyard is closed and we get to watch them through the windows.
Our latest birds are two barn owls.
They seem to be small ones that are learning to fly and who have decided that our
nice enclosed, landscaped area is perfect for getting their wings.
</p>
<p>
So, for the moment, we cannot lunch in the sun.
