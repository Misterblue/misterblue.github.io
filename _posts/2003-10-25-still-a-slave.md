Nearly two weeks ago I blogged about a
<a href="http://www.misterblue.com/mt/archives/20031012-slave_to_his_instincts.html">bird that is pecking at our windows</a>
.
Well, it's two weeks later and he's still at it!!
He is either sitting on the tree at the front of the house and
flying up to the front window and pecking at it
(tap, tap, tap on the window)
or he's sitting on the fence and flying up to the windows
at the side of the house.
</p>
<p>
I'm amazed he's still doing it.
How long will this go on?
