We've been down for a day -- the DSL failed.  Bummer.
</p>
<p>
I finally got a simple enough network setup at my end so my ISP would talk to me.
They required a single computer with a crossover cable plugged into the modem before they wanted to talk to me about line problems.  I guess they get enough problems with people's home equipment.
So, they finally decided that my computers were outputting ARP packets and they were responding to them but I was not receiving any of their packets.  Time to call the DSL provider -- Qwest.
</p>
<p>
I've heard bad things about getting technical support from the phone companies, so, with trepidation, I phoned the tech support number.
Pressed "2" to say I had DSL.
Pressed "3" to say I was not using Quest as my ISP,
Pressed "2" to say this was a new problem.
And I was talking to an actual human!!!!!
No waiting, no hassle.
Wow!!!
I explained that I'd talked to my ISP and they said to call Qwest.
He typed for a second and said "yes, you do have a problem".
"There is a tech on the way to fix it".
One hour later the connection was running again.
</p>
<p>
So, there are a lot of terrible stories out there, but this is a good story about DSL and phone company technical support and it has a happy ending.
And now I have connectivity so my life can go on.
