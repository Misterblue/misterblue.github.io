I had my appointment with the cardiologist yesterday and he listened to my heart, too my blood pressure, talked for a bit and said I was healing perfectly.
Since I'm such a young guy ("premature onset cardio disease" is the term he used) I am healing just as I should be.

So, I left his office with perscriptions for cholesterol and blood pressure meds (for the rest of my life), a pointer to a dietition, a perscription for some "base line" blood work and a followup appointment in April.

I guess he thinks I'll survive this.
