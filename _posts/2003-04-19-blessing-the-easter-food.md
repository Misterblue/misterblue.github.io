    Cool church! Never been to a Polish Mass. Well, actually, with little kids, it never feels like I have been to Mass any Sunday.

<p>
As part of our 
Polish Easter traditions
, each year, we take some of the food we are cooking for Easter to
St Stanislaus Church
to be blessed.
Most of the service is in Polish so us people who only married a 
Polish girl and who didn't grow up in a Polish house, just sit and
enjoy the Catholic iconery.
