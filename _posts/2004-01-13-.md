    Nice pictures! And what a great view from your window! When I had gallbladder surgery last May, all I had to look out at was a brick wall. LOL

    Continued prayers for a quick recovery. It will take time, but you will get your strength back.

    Good morning to you and your family - and my best wishes for a full, speedy recovery.  My own mother has been hospitalized 700 miles away with a stroke and diabetes complications, so please know that I do feel for you and your family.  Any time a loved one goes through a medical crisis is tough on the whole family unit.  You take good care.  We love the Livingroom Cam!!!!!

    Sincerely,

    Kelli Mallard and family (husband Randy and three girls ages 2 to 10)
