<p>
My wife's
<a href="http://wyvernrunning.com/">business</a>
has a vendor's booth at the
<a href="http://www.racecenter.com/bluelake/index.htm">Blue Lake Triathlon and Duathlon</a>
event this weekend.
Since it was close to home,
the family was signed up to setup and man the booth.
So, this weekend, I've been selling athletic products.
I have some
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/20050806-Tri/">pictures</a>
of us and the event.
