Over the next month or so I will be traveling around the US. You know, getting in the car and spending ungodly amounts of money to power the car filled with kids and luggage in order to  take in the grandness that is America. I will be posting daily entries here from my little mobile phone. Picture and commentary typed into a little 10 key pad. I haven't upgraded to one of those fancy key board phones so appreciate all of the pecking that goes into adding text to the pictures.

You will see some test postings over the next week as I get the mobile blogging through Flickr working. Then it's on the road.
