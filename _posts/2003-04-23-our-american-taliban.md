Over at the
<a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/">BuzzMachine</a>
, Jeff Jarvis blogged about some similarity between Christian and Muslim
religious "fanatics".  
The article is
<a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2003_04.html#003623">Our American Taliban</a>
</p>

While often a discussion on this topic degenerates into an apples and
oranges comparison shouting match ("How could you possibly equate someone
who wants to stop all non-married people living together to someone who cuts
the hands off theives!!"),  there is some truth in there somewhere.
Our founding fathers fretted about the separation of church and state
not because they thought the state shouldn't give any money to religion but
because they didn't want the "clerics" making the decisions.
God fearing men must run the secular government, but the   governement
does not do things because it is God's law.
