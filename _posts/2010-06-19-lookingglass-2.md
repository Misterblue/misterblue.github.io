The updates for LookingGlass have been happening over at the <a href="http://lookingglassviewer.org">official web site</a>.

Camera and avatar  movement is MUCH smoother because of finding bugs and adding position  and rotation animation code. That also means that movement of animated  objects is now smooth. LG works great in OSGrid/Lbsa Plaza but larger  sims like OSGrid/Wright Plaza stretch the bounds of memory. SkyX now  works with OpenGL although the shaders aren't all together for the sun  and moon lighting. Avatars are still stuck in T-pose and attachments are  at the feet. Sitting avatars now are near the sit location and not at  the sim's 0,0. Also upgraded to the latest libomv. A new Windows 32-bit  installation package is in the <a href="http://www.lookingglassviewer.org/wiki/Download">download section</a>.
