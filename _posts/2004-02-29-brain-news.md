    The
    <a href="http://human-nature.com/nibbs">News in Brain and Behavioural Sciences Newsletter</a>
    is full of fun stuff this week:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The fraction of left-handed people today
            is about the same as it was during the Ice Age
        </li>
        <li>
            People with a history of the digestive
            disorder celiac disease are three times more
            likely to develop schizophrenia than those without the disease
        </li>
         <li>
            The ability to appreciate other people's agony
            is achieved by the same parts of the brain
            that we use to experience pain for ourselves
        </li>
        <li>
            Just missing breakfast makes you more
            sensitive to sweet and salty tastes
        </li>
        <li>
            Changes in hormone levels cause many women to be
            more critical of other women, according to a recent study
            <i>
            [this is one of those "duh" things -- women, and
            the men who live with them, have known this for
            years. --MB]
            </i>
        </li>
        <li>
            Human beings are the only animals
            that have asymmetrical brains
        </li>
        <li>
            A new study of young mothers by researchers at
            University College London (UCL) has shown that
            romantic and maternal love activate many of the
            same specific regions of the brain, and lead to a
            suppression of neural activity associated with critical
            social assessment of other people and negative emotions.
            The findings suggest that once one is closely familiar
            with a person, the need to assess the character and
            personality of that person is reduced,
            and bring us closer to explaining why,
            in neurological terms, 'love is blind.'
        </li>
        <li>
            Researchers have identified areas of the brain
            where what we're actually doing (reality) and what
            we think we're doing (illusion, or perception) are processed.
        </li>
    </ul>
