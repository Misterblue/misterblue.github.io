I came home from work early so I could sit at my computer and just type without the distractions of the work place.
I was sitting, typing when I heard a "pop".
Sounded like a pop gun.
Odd.  I looked around. I looked outside the window.
Nothing there.
Well, back to work.
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later, the computer started going "found new hardware", "hardware disconnected", "found new hardware", "hardware disconnected" with beeps and bells and the little popup from the toolbar.
I was scratching my head over this when I noticed smoke.
Smoke!!
White billowy smoke coming out of the back of the PC chassis!!
ACK!!!
I jump under the table and unplug the computer.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure exactly what happened.
The "pop" could have been one of the
much discussed reports of 
<a href="http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2003Feb/bch20030207018535.htm">bad capacitors on motherboards</a>
and some of the capacitor are 
<a href="

.
But the smoke came from my ATI All-In-Wonder card 
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/20031121-Smoke/">melting itself into it's AGP socket</a>
.
Serious short circuilt.
</p>
<p>
Well, off to get a new motherboard.
Look out of you have a motherboard from 2002.
