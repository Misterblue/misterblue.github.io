<div class="picLeft"><a href="/images/oldimages/1633"><img src="/images/oldimages/thumb/1633" class="oldImageThumb"/></a></div>I went to <a href="http://www.oregonstateparks.org/park_211.php">Silver Falls State Park</a> this weekend. The falls were tremendous but I misjudged the weather. I thought a forecast of "showers" meant the rain would eventually stop. But no. It kept pouring and pouring and pouring. I got soaked.
I also only made it to the first two falls. They were tremendously full because of all the rain. There were even some other crazy Oregonians enjoying the rain with me. <a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/g/main.php?g2_itemId=1570">Pictures were taken</a>.
