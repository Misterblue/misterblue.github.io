Merry Christmas to everyone all over the world!!
</p>
<p>
We've just finished opening presents this Christmas morning and people are assembling toys -- radio controlled cars and power tools.
Toys for all ages.  We'll start cooking breakfast soon.
</p>
<p>
Santa also gave all the kids
<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/cubegoodies/toys/60b6/">Airzooka's</a>
so there are battles ensuing around the house. 
You just don't know when a blast of air might hit you.

<p>
A few people have joined us in our
<a href="http://misterblue.com/xmaschat2003/chat-2.0.1/">Christmas morning chat room</a>
and you can see the mess on

.
Merry Christmas!!
