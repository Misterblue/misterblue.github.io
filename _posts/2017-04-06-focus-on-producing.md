I've been enjoying retirement but I have come to feel that I am missing
some organization. So, while spending a lot of time enjoying life, I
have set the goal of spending half-a-day producing something.

Most anything, really.

I have some home business to take care of but, other project-wise,
I have lots of ideas for virtual world/augmented-reality work which I
will putter along with.

So, I have two things to focus on: 1) producing something new every day
(could be research or code), and 2) writing a blog entry everyday about what
I learned or coded.

Onward and upward.
