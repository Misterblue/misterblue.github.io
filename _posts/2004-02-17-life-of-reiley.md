    One of the few advantages of being on medical leave is
    the ability to stay in bed late into the morning.
    In fact, I just spent two very enjoyable mornings in
    bed -- lying late under the warm covers,
    window open with the cool air coming in over me,
    rain falling outside
    and a
    <a href="http://misterblue.com/Books/MisterBlue_Books.shtml#Pattern%20Recogn
ition">good book</a>
    in my hands.
    A soft bed with 400 count sheets is a nice place
    to read.
