This isn't a dead blog.  I've just been off doing other things.
But I have piles of pictures to get up and comments to make so this week I will be putting up a
new entry every day.  Most of them will be from the past but it's time to catch up.

Today I ran 15 miles to get ready for the
Disneyworld Marathon
that's in early January.
I have a lot of training to do to get ready for that race.
But, you can see from the pictures that it was a beautiful fall day
here in the Willamette Valley.  The rain even held off for the run.
