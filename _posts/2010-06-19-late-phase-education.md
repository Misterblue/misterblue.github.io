I have some ideas for data coding (more on that in a later post) but it required me to do some heavy weight math. It has been a long time since I did math so I needed some refreshers. One amazing resource is the online MIT classes at <a title="MIT Open Course Ware" href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">MIT Open Course Ware</a>. They have video lectures, class notes and exercises for freshman to graduate.

I'm making my way through <a title="Single varialbe calculus" href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/">freshman calculus</a>. Have to begin somewhere and I've forgotten a lot. It's like a foreign language -- if you don't use it, you loose it.
