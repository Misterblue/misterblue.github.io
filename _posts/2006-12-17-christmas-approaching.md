I can tell Christmas is quickly approaching. The tension is rising as preparations for the extended family being here on Christmas Eve (that's around 20 people) with <a href="http://www.polishcenter.org/Christmas/WIGILIA-ENG.htm">Wagilia</a> dinner for the immediate family at sundown before. That will mean serious logistics. But, in the mean time, we went shopping today and made sure we got to the store early to miss the crush. There's a lot of shopping going on out there.
