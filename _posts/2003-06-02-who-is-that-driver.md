So, I'm driving down the highway and run across one slow car holding up traffic.  As I pass them, I am compelled to look over at the person to see who it is.  Why do I think looking at them would tell me anything?  I find I do this with all sorts of "car people" -- who'd drive that type of car, who'd drive that fast, who'd stay in the fast lane when they're not the fast car.  It's as if somehow I'm learning something by seeing their face -- that I'd know what type of person acts like this or maybe I'd learn why they act like they do.

Do other people do this?
