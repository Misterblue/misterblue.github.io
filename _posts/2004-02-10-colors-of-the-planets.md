I'm constantly amazed by what can be found on the web
</p>
<p>
At
<a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>,
there is the mention of the not well publisized (at least in the US)
<a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/10/2044223&mode=thread&tid=134&tid=160">
Russian Rovers on the Moon</a> (including a rover that lasted 11 months and sent back TV pictures from the surface).
This lead to articles on the
<a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/10/2044223&mode=thread&tid=134&tid=160">
Soviet</a> 
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/venera.html">exploration</a>
of Venus (with pictures taken from the Venus surface)
and eventually to people who
worry about the
<a href="http://www.donaldedavis.com/2002_addons/SSYCOLRS.html">
color of the planets</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Yes,  that's right, the color of the planets.
It seems that the cameras we sent out into the universe have many
limitations (they take multiple filtered images that are merged together
or they use reference colors that are effected by the planetary conditions)
so there is some controversy on what the images really look like.
There are those that think that Mars is 
<a href="http://www.donaldedavis.com/PARTS/MARSCLRS.html">
not the bright red</a>
most of us have seen.
And the colors of Saturn or Pluto -- that's a whole different discussion.
</p>
<p>
Like I said, I'm amazed by what I can learn on the web.
It's not all drek.
