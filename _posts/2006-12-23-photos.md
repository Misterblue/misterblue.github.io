I'm experimenting with a new <a href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net/">gallery system</a>. The old collection of pictures was PHP code I wrote, but with all the worries about security and all the features that are typical today, I decided to try out a system that allows comments and rating and albums and other neat things.
There are now random pictures in the sidebar and, over time, I will load all my pictures.
