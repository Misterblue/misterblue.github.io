Yesterday's 
marathon training run
was 12 miles 
around downtown Portland
but, because of security around the fleet that is docked downtown 
and the setup for the
<a href="http://www.rosefestival.org/grand_floral_parade.htm">Grand Floral Parade</a>
-- all part of the city's
<a href="http://www.rosefestival.org/">Rose Festival</a> --
we ran south from downtown through the beautiful
Clearwater Corridor.
</p>
<p>
This is a 40 mile loop bike trail that goes along the Willamette River.  The section we ran (no, we didn't do the full 40) was along the east side of the river from downtown to the Sellwood bridge.  Green and lush with eagle's nests on the tops of power polls and attractions like the old fashioned amusement park 
<a href="http://www.oakspark.com/">Oaks Park</a>.
</p>
<p>
Except for the heat, it was a beautiful and good run.
