I'm travelling to Princeton, New Jersey for a few days.  It's like visiting a different country.   I grew up on the west coast and have lived there my whole life and I've never spent any time anywhere on the east  coast -- I've visited a time or two but I've never wandered around the countryside.

There are more desciduious trees (in the
Pacific Northwest
we have more evergreens.
Why is it that people look different, in general?  People in an east coast airport look "different" than people on the west coast.
Why is that?

Pictures coming soon.
