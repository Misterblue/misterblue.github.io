I spent a day driving around upstate New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.
This year was not an award winning year for autumn colors --
rather than a "snap" the brought all of the trees to color
at the same time, the change was more gradual.
Some areas had beautiful, bright trees while others would have
winter ready bare trees.
I, of course, took

.

Vermont seemed to have more farms and less small businesses.
It could have been the route I took, but things changed as I drove
from New York into Vermont.
The NY side had stores and shops while in Vermont, there were
farmer's markets.  The towns in Vermont seemed more upscale,
less rundown and more relating to the colonial past.
NY seemed to be more aligned with the industrial growth of
the early 1900s.
I have no clue what was different in the two states -- taxes?
land use planning?
It would be an interesting study.

Driving through the little towns of New England is a very quaint
experience for this west coast guy.
Peterstown, Hoosick Falls, Bremmington, Hollinsburg -- all towns
laid out before the car had taken over the land.
On the west coast, we were mostly laid out after the automobile
and that has changed the scale and number of towns.

State route number change as you drive across state lines.
Route 7 in NY turns into 9 in Vermont and then you take a
different 7 south into New Hampshire.
All a local naming scheme.
</p>
<p>
Vermont has a lot of stone fences.

The old houses are either immaculately kept up or they are
falling apart with paint peeling off and overgrown plants
around.
