    Great post!

<p>
    I don't usually blog about
    political
    or
    moral
    topics, but recently I've run across a few things that
    are troubling me and which need a society wide discussion.
    But I haven't seen them anywhere else.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/">Kuro5hin</a>
    as an
    <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/19/9735/19430">article</a>
    about the U.S. House of Representatives bill
    <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:HR03920:">HR3820</a>
    The bill, titled the
    "Congressional Accountability for Judicial Activism Act of 2004,"
    would grant Congress the right to overturn the decisions
    of the U.S. Supreme Court "to the extent that [they concern]
    the constitutionality of an Act of Congress."
    A two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress
    would be required to overturn such a decision;
    this is the same condition applied to overturning
    a Presidential veto of legislation.
    The bill is currently in committee.
</p>
<p>
    The constitution already stipulates that the congress and the
    people can make anything constitutional by passing an amendment.
    In the past, the law makers can make anything legal by passing
    new laws.
    But this changes the rules and makes congress (and it's controlling
    party in the current congressional dynamics) the supreme
    power in the land without reqiring the people (us) to vote.
</p>
<p>
    The
    New Orleans Channel 6 News
    <a href="http://www.theneworleanschannel.com/news/2953483/detail.html">reports</a>
    that the
    5th Circuit Court of Appeals
    as ruled that Louisiana cops don't need a search or
    arrest warrent to conduct a brief seach of your home or
    business if the officer "fears for his safety".
</p>
<p>
    Now, most cops aren't bad guys, but it's a tough job out there
    and people are shooting at you.
    That doesn't make for the best of situations for making
    reasoned and balanced decisions.
    And any claim of checks and balances go out the window unless
    there is a video camera present.
</p>
<p>
    Enough of my soap box.
    The real problem I see is that both of these are serious
    changes in the norm or the percieved norm of what we
    consider the balance of power and justice.
    Why aren't these being brought up for public discussion?
    How can we be an informed populous when things like this
    can be proposed and acted on while most people don't hear
    about it.
</p>
<p>
    I am bothered by this.
    Earth to Media!!  
    There's news happening!!
</p>
