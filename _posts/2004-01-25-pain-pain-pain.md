It's been a little over two and a half weeks since my surgery and I really haven't had much pain.
The doctor perscribed Vicodin(r) but, except for a run in with migraines a week ago, I haven't needed them.
My complaints have mostly been being out of breath, tired and just plain run down.
</p>
<p>
Until this week, that is.
It's like the bones in my chest and the muscles around them are finally waking up and they are looking around and sending paniced messages to my brain.
"Do you have any idea what happened down here??!?!?!!", they are shouting.
Time for a little pain meds while the system settles down.
