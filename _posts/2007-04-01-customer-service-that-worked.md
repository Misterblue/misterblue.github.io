Sometimes customer service actually works. I bought a new Samsung LCD monitor. Saddly, the screen glows red and it's WAY TOO BRIGHT. So, I phone 1-800-SAMSUNG, go through the several levels of automated selections ("press '1' if you're calling about a consumer product"...) and, within one (!!) minute, a fellow answered. I told him my problem. He had me unplug cables and describe the problem. Then he said, "Sounds like it needs to be replaced". A few minutes of reading the model and serial numbers and, viola!, a new monitor is on it's way to me.
Amazing. There are horror stories, but sometimes it just works.
