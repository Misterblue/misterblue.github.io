I'm on a get-work-done kick.
This means more updates here.
I considered moving to [Medium] to get a wider audience
but that is not my goal.
My purpose of these pages is for me and I'm not working on my
career and my visability.

So, just more updates.

This push toward organization and making visible progress is coming from
my recent interest in all the project that Elon Musk has started.
Between [SpaceX], [Boring Company], [NeuraLink], and others, this
man is changing things.

I could go on-and-on about what I think about these companies but,
what applies to this post is that this one person is making
world changing things happen.
Reading about what he has made happen makes me think:
"I have some big ideas that could change things. Why aren't I doing big things?".

So, more organization and more visible work.
