Just got back from seeing the
<a href="http://movies.go.com/movies/M/matrix3the_2001/index.html"Matrix Revolutions</a>
.
If you are a Matrix fan, you'll probably go see it no matter
what anyone says.
If you are not a Matrix fan, you probably won't see it unless
you are married to or otherwise attached to a Matrix fan.
Any way it happens, you will be disappointed.

<p>
The conclusion of this trilogy follows what usually happens to
book trilogies -- somehow the last book of the series as grown
to 600 pages and it's like no one can tell the author that 
they need to tighten it up.

Sigh.  Most of my dislike of the movie is my disappointment
at what could have been.  And that's much like the
Starwars movies.  Disappointing.
