    And, your "people blog" is just what I like.  No profanity, just the fabric of life, and some great pictures.



    Hooray!  Here's to another minute of fame (applause)

<p>
Adding another minute to my 15 minutes of fame,
the local metro section of the Oregonian wrote an article about blogging
in this part of town.  Check out
<a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/metrosouthwest/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/metro_southwest_news/1107867489315370.xml">Blogging is setting free the inner journalist in people</a>
</p>

When the reported contacted me last week, she was looking for mothers who blog --
I guess there was an article about same in the
Wall Street Journal
or something.
But, what she found in this area was me and a few other people who
just blog their lives.
She didn't want political blogs or news blogs.
She wanted people blogs.
And she found me.</p>
