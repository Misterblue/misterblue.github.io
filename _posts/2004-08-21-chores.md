After finishing all the work on the
rental, I today had some time for chores around here.
So, a quick trip to the
transfer station to drop off some garbage and old pesticides.
A stop at my mother's followed by a stop at the 
comic book store
(what I read is a subject for another entry)
</p>
<p>
The afternoon was filled by putting fertilizer on the lawn.
Well, more than just fertilizer -- it need lots of help so it
got clay breaker-upper, root growth enhancer, bug killer
as well as the nitrogen.
Then some putting around the house before cooking steaks
for the family and dog.
</p>
<p>
Now I'm here filling in my blog. 
Live goes on.
