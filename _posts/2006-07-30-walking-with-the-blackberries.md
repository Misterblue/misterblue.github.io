<p>This is that time of year. Yes, the time when a walk around the neighborhood means purple fingers and seeds between the teeth. The blue berries are ripening along the roadways and paths. A walk requires stopping and sampling. People with buckets collect berries for pies and breakfast.</p>
<p>What a yummy time of year</p>
