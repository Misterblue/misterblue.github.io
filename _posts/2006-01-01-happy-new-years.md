Happy New Year to everyone!
</p>
<p>
Here, we had my son's friends over for an all night, teenager party.  Little sleep was had and much caffeine was consumed.  There was also the request for a shop vac at 12:30am after the 
<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/11/04/military_application.html">Silly String</a>
 got everywhere. They're good kids and vac'ed up their own mess.
</p>
<p>
The big project for New Years Day is repacking all the Christmas stuff.
There have been several large boxes that are carted in and out of the garage
every year and dug through for the new things we use.
It is finally time to sort through them all, keep what we should be keeping
and repack everything into new Christmas themed tubs from Lowes.
</p>
<p>
Tonight is Family Fun Night so you'll see us playing some game
on <a href="http://www.livingroomcam.us/">LivingroomCam</a>.
</p>
<p>
Hope everyone has a great new year.
