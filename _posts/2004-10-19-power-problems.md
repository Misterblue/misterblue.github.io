Boy, go away for the weekend and power supplies start dropping like flies.
I've replaced the power supply in the server and  things are back up again.
Well, I haven't actually replaced the power supply yet.
I have two computers downstairs that look like two cars beside the road with one giving a jump to the other -- two chassis are side by side with the power supply from one running into the other chassis.
I have a trip to Frys planned to get a new supply (and probably a UPS to prevent these power glitch problems).

Sorry for having gone AWOL.
