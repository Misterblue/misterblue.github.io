<p>
It was another year and another Halloween.
The
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/20051031-Halloween/">pictures</a>
show that we again carved pumpkins, gave out candy and had a good time.
This year we had the family over (the kids and their families) to carve pumpkins
so everyone had a hand in creating the Halloween spirit.
