I arrived in England without a hitch.  Well, except for the long line to get through immigration – there was a 30 minute queue for us “other passport” people.  I took the Heathrow Express from the airport to Paddington station.  I arrived Monday morning during rush hour so the place had this rhythm of trains pulling in and masses of men and women in business attire pored out of the trains, cell phone to ear as they flowed out into the surrounding streets.  A quick train from Paddington to Bristol and I was at my first destination.
