I am about to make a video of logging into Wright Plaza and flying around but I wanted to get shadows working first. I introduced an oddity whereby the brightness of a prim is tied to it's x or y rotation. I just can't find the problem but, since it makes most buildings have large black sections, I have to find the bug before I show LG off. Other than that, LG allows logging into and navigating most sims.
