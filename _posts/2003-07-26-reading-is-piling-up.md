The
<a href="http://www.misterblue.com/Books/MisterBlue_books.shtml">book list</a>
hasn't been changing much because I haven't had time to read novels.
Instead I've been reading magazines and comics.
Definitely not literature, but something to fall asleep to at night.

My reading has been thining out but today famine turned into feast.
In the mail the
<a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.si.edu/">Smithonian</a>
arrived along with newsletters from
<a href="http://www.japanesegarden.com/">The Japanese Garden</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.cloudmountain.org/">Cloud Mountain Retreat Center</a>
.
I went to the comic book store and they had my
<a href="http://www.thesimpsons.com/">Simpsons</a>
,
<a href="http://www.gotfuturama.com/">Futurama</a>
,
<a href="http://www.cupped-expressions.net/amg/">Oh My Goddess</a>
,
<a href="http://www.usagiyojimbo.com/">Usagi Yojimbo</a>
,
and 
<a href="http://www.studioproteus.com/smb.html">Super Manga Blast</a>
.
I can now fall asleep to a varied collection of light entertainment.
