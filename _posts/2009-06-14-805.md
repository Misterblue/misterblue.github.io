I've been tweaking the LookingGlass web site at <a href="http://lookingglassviewer.org/">http://lookingglassviewer.org/</a>. Just another thing to add to the project -- learning MediaWiki. But the seem is new so it doesn't look like the default MediaWiki page. More formatting is needed but that will come with time.
<p>
I will be updating my progress programming here and on that site. Manual cut-and-paste at the moment. That is another thing for automation.
