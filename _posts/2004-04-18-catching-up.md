  content: I remember the dogwoods from when we lived in Federal Way, WA (94-95).  Everything was sooooo green.  I miss that :)  Living in the SoCal desert is so different.

    I lived in San Jose California for 10 years and I always noticed how green it was when I came home to Oregon.  I'm not the type to live in the desert.

Finally have some computer time so I've been catching up on my pictures.
The pictures from the play
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com//20040409-Tango/">Tango Lessons</a> are there.
Easter was enjoyed with a 
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com//20040411-Easter/">family dinner at Grandma's</a>
and, it being a beautiful springtime here in with
Willamette Valley,
there are 
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com//20040417-Flowers/">pictures</a>
of the dogwoods and roddies.

<p>
Happy Spring.
