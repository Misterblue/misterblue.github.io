    You have to remember, that painting is a service to the public.  It is not something that has to be done for the safety of the building. Therefore, what we do is a service for the customer who has no desire to do the job himself, therefore you will get the high dollar amount on your bids.

Looks like I'm spending the next few days painting.
The remodel has reached the point where the walls are plastered and textured.
We asked for some painting bids and they all came back between $2500 and $3500.
That seems like a LOT of money to paint three rooms  that are still in construction phase (no carpet, no trim, plastic already over windows from plasterers). 
So, I'm doing it myself.

I'll go to work next week paint splattered.
