I am sitting in my back yard looking out over the green lawn, listening to the mowers of suburbia and connected wirelessly with my laptop.
The weather is a warm 70F here in Oregon and I am sitting in the shade of an early leafing tree.
The wind is blowing and it will be chilly tonight since it is not summer yet.
Only spring.

But my observation is on the pleasentness at sitting in the green, warm yard of a home in America.
The level of wealth is phenomenal.
Here I am, sitting listening to the wind in the trees, connected to the Internet while others are starving and dying.
I am so lucky and blessed.
How can this be while others are suffering?</p>
