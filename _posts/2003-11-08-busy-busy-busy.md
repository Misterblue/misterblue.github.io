Today is being spent doing tasks around the house.  The remodel is almost done so I'm doing finish work (sealing the tile, chalking, adding fasteners for tile access panels) and any time left over will be spent moving into te new area.  My family has it's priorities -- the computers move first.

Then there are regular home tasks: snaking the downstairs shower,  mowing the lawn for the last time this year, raking leaves.   And the kids want to see the new Matrix movie tonight.

Can't say I'm not alive.
