Made it through Halloween.
There weren't as many trick-or-treaters as there usually are -- I don't know if the cold weather kept them away or if there are fewer little kids this year.
I took

of some of the ones who did come to our door.

But there are teenagers around.  We woke up to find that someone
(or, more likely a groups of someones)
had taken most of the carved pumpkins off the porches up and
down the street and smashed them.
The drive down the block was slippery.
