<p>
Everyone in my group was out of town.
That means hours of quiet.
Hours of no voices over the cubical walls.
Hours of focusing on one task after another without interruption.
Hours of completing one thing and then working on the next to completion.
</p>
<p>
What a strange and rare experience.
