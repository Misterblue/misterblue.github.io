Look out in the Pacific Northwest -- there is a blimp on the loose.
</p>
<p>
With this hot weather, when I get up in the morning, I open the patio door and
start a large fan to get some of the cool air outside inside.
The other morning, after running the fan for a while, I found my
<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/cubegoodies/toys/5b5f/">
remote controlled flying saucer</a>
outside in the trees by the patio.
It would seem that the air currents pushed the floating craft around the livingroom
and eventually out the patio door.
</p>
<p>
This morning I wasn't so lucky as to find the craft in the trees.  I'd
forgotten about the tree incident a few days before when I set up
the fan this morning.
So now, floating in the skies far above our town, must be a radio
controlled blimp enjoying it's freedom in the wide open skys.
