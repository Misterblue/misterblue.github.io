The family has spent the last week at
<a href="http://www.blackbutteranch.com/">Black Butte Ranch</a>
hanging out in the semi-desert of Central Oregon amid golf courses,
miles of trails and houses that are worth more than most houses back
in Portland.

<p>
I haven't been here all week because of work.
But I made it for the last few days --saddly, we go home tomorrow.
I've been cramming in as much hiking and bike riding as I can.
My rear hurts in ways it hasn't hurt in a long time (that's another
topic -- why the heck haven't bicycle seats been figured out?).
Now, I'm sitting on the back deck, looking out over green grass and
off to snow covered mountains and enjoying the good life for
one more evening.
