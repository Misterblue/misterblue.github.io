    Ever drive down the highway and think about all the
    stone that makes up the road?
    Think of it -- the highway is miles long and nearly
    a foot thick.
    Think of how many mountains of rock were dug up and
    amd trucked around.

    If you go flying much, you do see missing mountains.
    Around every major city, there is at least one
    hole where a hill used to be.
