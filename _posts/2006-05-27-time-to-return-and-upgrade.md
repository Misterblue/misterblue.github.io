It's time to get back to this blogging thing.
But first, I will upgrade my server and blogging sofware to the latest version of everything.
The main aggrevation of maintaining one's own server is the continual upgrading required as new exploits are discovered.

Anyway, I'll be back in a few days with shiny new everything.
And even some more blog entries.
