  content: How can it be that gay marriage (which is thought to be MORALLY WRONG by those who believe in the Bible) can be illegal in a country where we are entitled to freedom of religion?  If the people of America were truely free, as they are said to be, they would have the right to marry one of the same gender for they do not have to adhere to the Bible.  IF the Constitution is amended to embrace the "Biblical Principles", that would be violationg the right to choose religion and it would defy the freedom claims of this country.

    This is what marriage will look like if
    the U.S. Constitution is amended to fully
    embrace the original "Biblical principles"
    based on the reading of the Holy Bible:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Marriage in the United States shall
        consist of a union between one man
        and one or more women.
        (
        Genesis 29:17-28;
        II Samual 3:2-5
        )
    </li>
    <li>
        Marriage shall not impede a man's right
        to take concubines in addition to his
        wife or wives.
        (
        II Samual 5:13;
        I Kings 11:3;
        II Cronicles 11:21
        )
    </li>
    <li>
        A marriage shall be considered valid
        only if the wife is a virgin.
        If the wife is not a virgin, she shall be executed.
        (
        Deuteronomy 22:13-21
        )
    </li>
    <li>
        Marriage of a believer and a non-believer shall
        be forbidden.
        (
        Genisis 24:3;
        Numbers 25:1-9;
        Ezra 9:12;
        Nehemiah 10:30
        )
    </li>
    <li>
        Since marriage is for life, no federal or state Constitution
        nor law shall be construed to permit divorce.
        (
        Deuteronomy 22:19;
        Mark 10:9
        )
    </li>
    <li>
        IF a married man dies without children, his brother shall marry
        the widow.  If he refuses to marry his brother's widow or
        deliberately does not give her children, he shall pay
        a fine of one shoe.
        (
        Genisis 38:6-10;
        Deuteronomy 25:5-10
        )
    </li>
</ol>
