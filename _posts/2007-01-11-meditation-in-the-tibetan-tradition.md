Last night I went to a talk by Kilung Jigme Rinpoche on <a href="http://www.newrenbooks.com/events/jan_reg.html#kilung">Meditation in the Tibetan Tradition</a>. Kilung Jigme Rinpoche is essentually an abbot of a monestary that is being rebuilt after the Chinese destroyed it during their invasion. At 14,000 feet, there is now a monistary and a school.
The talk was general (general techniques) and he described some of the main features of the Tibetan Buddist mediation method. About 30 people attended.
