Over at <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">ThinkGeek</a>  I stumbled on the <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/cubegoodies/toys/5b4a/">smoke ring gun</a>.  I was "I gotta have" at first sight.  I mean is shoots cool, floating smoke rings!!! 
</p>
<p>
Well, it arrived in the mail yesterday and the kids and I have almost gone through a whole bottle of smoke fluid (which is A LOT of smoke rings).  So standing over the stairs (where there are overhead lights that make the rings stand out) you can find us shooting smoke rings.
</p>
<p>
There is a "speed" setting on the gun which sets the speed that the smoke rings speed away from the gun.  The current game is to shoot a slow ring then switch to fast rings and try and shoot through the slow moving ring.
