I was crusing Amazon for CDs when I ran across a
"free download"
of the hit track from
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009YXGH/Misterblue">Three Days Grace</a>
.
</p>
<p>
I thought I'd give it a try.  Download... download.  Drag and drop onto Windows Media Player.  What ho?  A popup saying need to get an "identification" and a 
licence for my for-free music track.  I press "yes" and "yes" and here I sit, 10 minutes later while Media Player sits saying "Aquiring license...".
</p>
<p>
This is not an improvement.  I just sat through a day of seminars on how
companies can do what they know how to do without really addressing
the customers needs or priorities.  For me, the spontanious wish to listen
to this song is passed and they've missed their opportunity.

<p>
They still don't get it.
