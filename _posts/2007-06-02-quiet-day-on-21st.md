<img class="blogHUDimg" src="http://bloghud.com/users/misterbluewaves/snaps/1180817283_snap_320.jpg" />It's a quiet day on 21st Street, Portland Oregon in <a href="http://secondlife.com">SecondLife</a>. The  instigator of the sim is traveling in Spain and us members are holding down  the fort.  <p>All the people involved in the 21st project are sending message from the  traveling instegator to a friend of hers who had a stroke. She is traveling  in Spain, she finds cyber cafes  and records blog entries. We phone up the  lady in the hospital and read the missive from Spain thus connecting the  person in the hospital bed to the adventure of the world. This is all  organized and done by people who met through SecondLife. How cool is that.</p>
