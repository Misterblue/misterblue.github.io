<p>
As the proud owner of an
<a href="http://www.archos.com/">Archos</a> Jukebox Recorder 20
(a European company who has been making disk based music players
for longer than most of the American companies),
I have to recommend the 
<a href="http://www.rockbox.org/">Rockbox</a>
project.
This is an open source replacement for the OS that runs on the
Jukebox.  It replaces the OS running there and provides everything from
longer battery life for verbal menu selections.
It is the existance proof of the benefits of an open source project --
benefits to both the company (more features, better support) and
the customers.
I use Rockbox and I send them my donations -- it's worth it.
