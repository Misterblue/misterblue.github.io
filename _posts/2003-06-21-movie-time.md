<p>
I took the boys to see The Matrix Reloaded tonight.
It was a Regal Cinema which is one of those gigantic theatre chains.  The notable part of the experience was the 20 minutes of commercials that came before the movie -- from television programs to XBox games -- and then the 12 minutes of previews before the movie.

People didn't seem too upset about all the previews but the television commercials before elicited the comment "I could watch television at home".
