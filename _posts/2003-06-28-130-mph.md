Driving home on the interstate this morning I was doing my usual 65 or so with the other traffic.  Then these kids zipped by.  I looked at my speedometer and guestimated they must be going more than 80.  But I also noticed that, in my car, 70 MPH has the speedometer needle pointing straight up.
</p>
<p>
My speedometer goes to 130MPH!!  Now, I don't drive a big Mercedes that has to  survive on the German autobaun.  
I drive a Saturn.  
I think it would fly apart above 100. 
 I only use the first half of the speedometer dial.

<p>
I just don't know what possessed the designers of the car to make the speedometer go that high.
Another of life's mysteries.
