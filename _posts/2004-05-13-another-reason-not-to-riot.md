<b>Riots suppreessed city's sex drive</b>
Italy: Riots at the G8 summit in Genoa in 2001 supressed the
sex drive of its residents and lead to a decline in births,
a study released yesterday shows.
Nine months after the riots, birth rates dropped by 29 per cent.
Even 11 months after the clashes, birth rates were 20
per cent lower than average.
