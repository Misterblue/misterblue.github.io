<p>
This is the wonderful thing  that is  the web.
<a href="http://www.phoons.com/">Phoons</a> has just grown from on fellows sillyness to an activity and sharing of many people.
This is similar to
<a href="http://pictureyourself.org/">Picture Yourself</a>
 so when you take your phoon picture, also add it to both collections.
What fun!!
