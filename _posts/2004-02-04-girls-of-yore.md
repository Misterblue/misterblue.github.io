On the front page of the October 26, 1908 Oregonian 
(which also had the 
<a href="http://www.misterblue.com/mt/archives/20040130-its_in_the_genes.html">article</a>
about the sudden death of my great-great-grandfather)
is this article decrying the drop in marriage certificates issued in Boston.
Clergymen were interviewed and they were sure that the phenomenon was due to "the girl of today liked her independence too much to marry".
This is enforced by "the prospective husband might not be able to furnish
er with the latest-cut gown and newest creation from the modiste shop".

Boy, if this trend started in 1908, things must be really messed up today :-) .
