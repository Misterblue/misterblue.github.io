  content: Oh my, my lawnmower is presently behind the snowblower. Our first mowing is a good couple of months away, anyway (LOL!!!)  Nice frost pictures, BTW.  Now if you'll pardon me, I have to find my mittens.

Since California is getting all of the Pacific Northwest's weather, that leaves us with several weeks of not much happening weather-wise.
Our days have been down to 30 at night but up to 60 during the day.
This is not a typical February.

What this has meant, though, is the first lawn mowing of the year happened this weekend.
The sounds of suburbia are returning early this year.
And the weather continues to be strange everywhere.
