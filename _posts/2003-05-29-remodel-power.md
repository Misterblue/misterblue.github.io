    Man, you are brave going through that remodel thing.  I enjoy seeing progress pics.  Brings back fond (:snort:) memories.

I haven't been very good at giving updates on the
remodel of our house
.
I'd better get it in quick or they'll be done.
But today the net would have noticed because the electrian
pulled the plug on the whole house while he re-wired the
electrical panel.  Desktop and server don't work too good
without electricity.

Well, the new electrical panel is in place.  Now we have to
wait for the power company to update the house panel.
