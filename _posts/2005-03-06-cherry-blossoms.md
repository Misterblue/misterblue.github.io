 The 
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/20050306-Cherry/">cherry blossoms </a>
are breaking out this first week of March. Here in Portland Oregon, we have been having drier than normal weather -- I heard somewhere that Las Vegas got more rain than we did this winter.

This Sunday, in the first week of March, the sky is blue, the sun is shining and it's 70 degrees.    There sounds in the air are those of mowers running and people working in their gardens.  All this a month or two early.

And we'll need to enjoy it before we have our long hot summer with drought.
