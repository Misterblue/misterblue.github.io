For anyone visiting this site to find out why I'm sending viruses around the net, it looks like this domain name is included in some virus package and there seem to be several zombies sending out viruses with a "From:" line pointing to this domain.  It's usually from somebody "@misterblue.com".

<p>
Needless to say, it's not me.  Curse all you virus writers.  You make the world miserable for the rest of us for a minimal, short-term benefit for yourself.  What selfish dolts.
