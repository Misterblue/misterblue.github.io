We actually got some snow!!!
While there are those that live with it and those who will say "what's the big deal" and those who will say "that's not as rare as snow in Florida", getting snow around here is rare and fun.

It wasn't much of a snow, though.
Things were white in the morning but my 9am, the roads were just wet.  When it froze last night, the streets were pretty much dry so ice wasn't a problem.
But still, snow!!
