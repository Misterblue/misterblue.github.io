As I mentioned in the <a href="http://twitter.com/misterblue/">Twitter </a>to the left, we drove into LA last night. It was really LA as we experienced freeway traffic jams on a Sunday evening. Amazing. It's in the 80's and a little humid with not a cloud in the sky. At this very moment, I'm sitting beside the pool at our hotel while the laundry goes around -- a necessity of travel.

The aquarium had a lot of amazing displays of fish and plants but the activities were all geared to young children. So we came, we oggled, we exited.

The next day was a visit to <a href="http://www.hearstcastle.com">Hearst Castle</a>. When I have 200 million dollars to spend on a house, I hope mine is this magnificent.<div class="g2image_float_right"><a href="/images/oldimages/2657.jpg"><img src="/images/oldimages/thumb/2657.jpg" class="oldImageThumb"/></a></div>

<div class="g2image_float_left"><a href="/images/oldimages/2541.jpg"><img src="/images/oldimages/thumb/2541.jpg" class="oldImageThumb"/></a></div>The rest of the day was spent driving down the California coast -- beautiful, beautiful, beautiful: the sea lions basking on the beaches, the white waves crashing against the rocks and the blue, blue ocean.
