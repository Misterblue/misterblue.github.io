    My company has just purchased Spam Bully for Outlook. Spam Bully support Exchange accounts, that is very good for us. And I have to say it is an absolutely excellent product. I tried and tested a few products before recommending SpamBully. It was by far the best - a brilliant piece of anti-spam software.

    I finally bought Spam Bully.  It works great.  I like it's feature of analyzing one's inbox as well as spam to automatically generate the white list as well as the black list.  My spam problem is to a managable level.

<p>
    The Misterblue email address has been around for nearly
    10 years so it's on every spam list imaginable -- I get
    between 100 and 200 pieces of spam a day.
    I've been using
    <a href="http://www.upserve.com/spammunition/">Spammunition</a>
    as my Outlook spam filter.
    I've really liked it.
    It's a Bayesian filter and one just moves spam into a folder,
    add the people you know are good to a 'white list'
    and it trains itself and after that, nearly all spam is
    moved into the spam folder as new mail arrives.
    There have been very few false positives (I once had a
    problem exchanging email with my doctor -- we were discussing
    my prescriptions and that was too close to spam'ness).
</p>
<p>
    Spammunition is free, but that also means that the developer
    can wander off to other projects.
    He seems to have done just that after getting married last
    year.
    It's now starting to crash every now and then and it's
    beginning to suffer from bit rot.
</p>
<p>
    So, it's time to get another filter.  A quick
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=spam+bayesian+outlook">Google</a>
    shows the following choices:
</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <a href="http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/">SpamBayes</a>
        </td>
        <td>
            Sourceforge
            project.
            Written in Python and looks to include mail proxies
            and a bunch of other bells and whistles.
            Uses Bayesian algorithm.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <a href="http://www.spambully.com/">Spam Bully</a>
        </td>
        <td>
            Commercial ($30) that looks to be well liked and
            well integrated into Outlook.
            Uses Bayesian algorithm plus other "advanced algorithms".
            Various "editor choice" awards.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <a href="http://www.inboxer.com/">InBoxer</a>
        </td>
        <td>
            Commercial ($28) that looks to be well liked and
            well integrated into Outlook.
            Uses Bayesian algorithm.
            Various "editor choice" awards.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <a href="http://www.outlook-spam-filter.com/">OutlookSpamFilter</a>
        </td>
        <td>
            Commercial ($25).
            Uses Bayesian algorithm.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
    And I'm sure there are many more.
</p>
<p>
    So, what have you tried?
    What works for Outlook (besides throwing it out the window)?
