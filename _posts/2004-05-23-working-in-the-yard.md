    He's here *vbg*

    only kidding.  I planned on taking the day off, but stopped this morning at a garden center.  2 flats and 3 geraniums later.........

    We're having rain off and on too.  More on than off.

<p>
It rained last night.
I've been hitting it lucky because I set some fence posts yesterday when it was dry -- before it rained.
On Thursday, I mowed the lawn and it then it rained Thursday night.
("Yes!!!" pumping arm).
I don't know why I'm being lucky.
If Murphy isn't here, where is he?
