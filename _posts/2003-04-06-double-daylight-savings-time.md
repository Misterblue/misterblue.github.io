I'm up rather early here.  I as smart and set my clock ahead one hour for daylight savings time.  But, it seems that my clock is a "smart" kind -- it knows how to adjust itself for daylight saving time!! So, the little computer in the clock also set clock ahead an hour for daylight savings time.  That makes it two.
