The garage sale is complete.  I fibbed a little saying that it was going on the Sunday -- the runners in the family had to be free for the <a href="http://www.portlandmarathon.org/">Portland Marathon</a> on Sunday so the sale was just Friday and Saturday.  Hope you stopped by to <a href="http://livingroomcam.us/"> check out</a> the action.

But, as with any garage sale, you are left with your garage and all that stuff that no one purchased.
We are now spending Sunday sorting, repacking, creating the "EBay pile" and the Goodwill pile.
It will take us days to recover.
