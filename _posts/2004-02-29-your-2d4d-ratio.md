    The always interesting
    <a href="http://human-nature.com/nibbs">News in Brain and Behavioural Sciences Newsletter</a>
    this week pointed to an
    <a href="http://www.canada.com/edmonton/edmontonjournal/story.asp?id=73E5071
0-35D4-4AFE-B252-8F1900D2B356">Edmonton Journal article</a>
    where an McMaster University evolutionary psychologist
    claims to have found that the length ratio of a woman's ring to
    index finger points to her sexual behaviour --
    from fantasies to the number of partners she might have.
</p>
<p>
    It has been known for a century (really?!) that the ratio between the
    length of the second finger (2D) and the ring finger (4D)
    varies between men and women and that a shorter 2D is the
    more masculine characteristic.
    Put your right hand flat on a table as see whether your
    ring finger (4D) is longer then your index finger (2D).
</p>
<p>
    Well, the finding is that shorter 2D (more male'ish) is
    coorelated with higher prenatal testosterone levels and
    that more male-like 2D:4D ratios on the
    right hand were linked to higher SOI scores --
    standard seven-item questionnaire called the
    Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI),
    which measures "a person's" willingness to engage in
    casual, uncommitted sex.
    That is, high prenatal testosterone levels
    lead to 'male-like' short-term mating tactics.
    These tests were given to woman -- shorter 2D indicated
    a woman engages in more
    "short-term mating tactics".
</p>
<p>
    So ladies, is your 2D shorter than your 4D?
