Last night, I took my son to a college meeting (tables for 35 colleges and many, many interested students).
The event was held in the
<a href="http://www.govhotel.com/">Governor Hotel</a>
here in Portland, Oregon.
This is an old hotel in downtown Portland that was built and decorated before
all hotels became bottom-line oriented, international corporation assets.
This building has artwork built into the walls.
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/20050808-GovernorHotel/">It is beautiful</a>.
