<div class="g2image_float_left"><wpg2>5936</wpg2></div>Since everyone else is going green, I decided I'd take mass transit for a day trip downtown and to the zoo. It is a short drive to the local transit station (there are no weekend buses in my immediate neighborhood) so I bussed from here to downtown. The Portland streetcar took me cross town where I had a pleasant morning coffee with some friends -- sitting in their old house with the windows open and the large trees overhanging the house and street. There are some great neighborhoods in the city.

<div class="g2image_float_right"><wpg2>5973</wpg2></div>The train to the deepest subway station in North America and up to the zoo. I haven't been in a few years and the place is expanding. There is a lot of construction. The monkey house is being remodeled for the great apes and the artic tundra exhibit has been torn out to be replaced with a large cat area. The zoo is not dying.

<div class="g2image_float_left"><wpg2>6003</wpg2></div>The elephant barn was closed to visitors. I finally noticed the TV trucks parked outside and, when I went into the display area, I found a crowd of people watching closed circuit TVs. Just a few hours earlier, the mother elephant's water had broken and there was great excitement over the imminent birth of an elephant. It could happen at any time. I waited around for about 30 minutes but eventually left. The baby was born about two hours later.

Mass transit worked wonderfully for me and the weather was lovely. A relaxing day.
