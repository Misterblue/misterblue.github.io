<p>Here is a thought about style rather than substance of the current War in Iraq situation</p>
<p>
One of the stereotypes of the 90s is the "Emperial CEO" and the go-go agendas and work habits of the high powered business world.  The CEO has an idea, he/she commands something to happen, and the minions execute it.  Even if it is a bad idea.  If the CEO as good ideas, this works great.  Enron is one example of this system going bad -- even the "oversight" accounting companies stretched the rules to make the goal happen.
</p>
<p>
Now think of the President of  the United States.  His background is not Washington, DC.  His background is corporate America.  He is our new CEO and he as some ideas.  And his minions are executing his ideas.
</p>
<p>
Even though the United States has the equivilent of Auther-Anderson, will they do just as well at oversight?
