I've been home from the hospital for 5 days now
and it's 10 days since my surgery.
Most of the pain is gone except for my leg -- they harvested a vein from my right leg to use on my heart and it seems like they just just it off and let it bleed every where.
I have this gigantic bruise from my crotch to my knee that is just now starting to look like it's getting better.
</p>
<p>
The fact that my sternum was cut open and then wired together is the other source of pain.
Coughing hurts and there are ways you can't lie in bed.
It also means that I can't drive for 6 weeks after the surgery because an air bag could do disasterous things to a partially healed sternum.
</p>
<p>
My main complaint these days is fatague and breathlessness.
The breathlessness is caused by only having about half my lung capacity back so  far.
The fatague means that walking out into the kitchen and back to get a drink of water will mean I have to sit down and rest for 10 minutes.
Surfing the web starts as an active activity but soon becomes a mindless television experience.
</p>
<p>
Everyone says it will be better next week and I'm looking forward to that.
At the moment, I don't even have the energy to get cabin fever.
