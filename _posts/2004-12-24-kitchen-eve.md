The old world tradition for Christmas Eve day is to spend the day in the kitchen.
So, keeping with our ancestors, we are cooking
<a href="http://www.santas.net/polishchristmas.htm">Wagilia</a> -- the traditional Polish Christmas Eve dinner.
This includes babka (a citrus'y bread),
golabki (rice and meat wrapped in cabbage leaves),
mushroom soup,
pierogies (dough filled with potatoes, cheese, sourkraut, prunes.. not all at the
same time),
and many more delicacies.
</p>
<p>
We'll be in the <a href-"http://christmascam.us/">kitchen</a>
 cooking most of the day.</p>
