<div class="g2image_float_left"><wpg2>1806</wpg2></div><div class="g2image_float_right"><wpg2>1788</wpg2></div>Saturday night I was invited to a game of the <a href="http://www.portlandjax.com/">Portland Lumberjacks</a> -- our local. professional lacrosse team. Not a winning team by any measure (they did lose this game) but thye manage to fill a stadium. Someone said they attracted more than the hockey games.

One reason for the invite was to watch someone I know as the team mascot. Someone is actually in those costumes. And he loves his job.
