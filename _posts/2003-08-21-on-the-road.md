The next week or so will be on the road.  This week I'm in Santa Clara, California doing business work.  
I get back to Portland on Friday but, rather than stay at home, I'm driving to
<a href="http://www.blackbutteranch.com/">Black Butte Ranch</a>
to spend one night with my family.
Then on Saturday, I'll drive back to Portland and get on a plane to 
Helsinki, Finland
to attend a conference.
I hope to put up some pictures before I come back -- it's a computer conference so I'll have connectivity.
Conference on Monday and Tuesday, then I get one day to see the city before getting on the plane back home.

No, not really home, because I immediatly drive to central Oregon to spend two nights looking at the stars at the
<a href="http://www.oregonstarparty.org/">Oregon Star Party</a>.
</p>
<p>
Maybe I'll get to recover on Labor Day.
