# Portland Temperatures

A local television weather forecaster showed a chart on their broadcast
the other day showing an increase in the number of days in a year
that had temperatures greater than 90.

It looked rather scary as, in  the last four or five years, the number
is heading steeply upward. This came up because Oregon USA is experiencing
record breaking temperatures this first week of June.

Some friends said there have been hot decades before so the last five years
isn't significant.
Well, this is the Internet, so I pulled Portland's temperatures since 1940
from the [US weather service] and did some calculations.

The below graph shows the number of days over a temperature for Portland, Oregon USA
from 1941 to present. The observation is that, while the current temperature
streak is not that out of line, the overall tread for the last 70 years is
upward.

I'll leave other people to argue about why and what to do about it.
