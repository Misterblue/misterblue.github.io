We're being te Great Remodel Project.  A few years ago we remodeled the kitchen and livingroom area.  Now we're remodelling the otehr half of the house.  This is a big project with moving walls and rearranging bathrooms.   I will eventually have a remodle page up with plans and pictures.  I may even move some of the

so I can have "remodel cam".

The downside is that the whole family has  to move into the basement for three months.  I'm packing this weekend while the family is in Paris.  That takes some of the stress off -- there is only myself to deal with -- but it also means I get to do all the work.

The contractor begins the demolition on Monday (March 24) so I'd better get packing.
