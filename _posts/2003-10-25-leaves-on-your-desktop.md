With autumn leaves falling outside, you should have leaves on your desktop.  One of the coolest programs around is
<a href="http://www.euronet.nl/~rja/AutumnLeaves/">AutumnLeaves</a>
which causes leaves to tumble down and collected on  the tops of your windows. 
The occasional falling nut and growing mushroom adds to the
wet and cool feeling of a chilly autumn morning.
It's shareware and worth paying for.
</p>
<p>
And, to add to the autumn effect, use one of 
these images (
<a href="http://misterblue.com/images/AutumnLeaves2.JPG">2048x1536</a>
,
<a href="http://misterblue.com/images/AutumnLeaves2-1600.JPG">1600x1200</a>
,
<a href="http://misterblue.com/images/AutumnLeaves2-1024.JPG">1024x768</a>
)
to complete your leafy desktop.

By the way, the AutumnLeaves author also has
<a href="http://www.euronet.nl/~rja/WinSnow/">Snow for Windows</a>
and
<a href="http://www.euronet.nl/~rja/Hanami/">Hanami</a>
(falling cherry blossoms)
so you can enjoy all of the seasons.
