My (previous post)[1] referred to something called a 'viewer'.
Let me describe what I mean by that.

For a person to look into a virtual world, they need some device and some
software to render a view into that virtual world onto that device.
These days, the hot devices are head mounted, stereographic displays
(see [Oculus][2], [GearVR][3], and many more) but 2D monitor screens
and tablets and phones do the job.

There is software that creates the pixels for the device.
This software must convert whatever representation the virtual world
keeps its contents in into a coherent three dimensional view for
the device. There are several very hard problems here. 
For instance, if the device is a head mounted display that is supposed
to give an immersive 3D experience (the user is supposed to fell like they
are "in" the 3D world), the view has to move with low latency with the
head so as to not cause nausea.

Describe X11 windows system.
