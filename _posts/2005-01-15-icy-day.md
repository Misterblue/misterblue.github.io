Portland Oregon, USA is experiencing an icy day.
The Willamette Valley doesn't do snowy winter very well -- we tend to get some snow, melt the snow and then freeze it all to create ice everywhere.
This time, we have an artic low inland and tropical, rainy high in the ocean.
The effect is freezing air on the ground and rainy weather on top.
Ice everywhere.

<p>
At the moment, it is 4pm, the outside temperature is 29F and the rain is still falling.
They say we should have just rain tomorrow -- the tropical rain will win out.
For the moment, I'm staying home.
Actually, most of the city is staying home.
