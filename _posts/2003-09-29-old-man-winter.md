<p>
This morning at 7am I stopped at my usual 7-Eleven to get my usual morning 
Big Gulp(tm) of Diet Coke(rg)
and, as I left the store, I told the clerk, "Have a good night".
I stopped in the parking lot and realized I had said that because it was dark outside.

<p>
Winter is coming and soon I will go to work in the dark and go home from
work in the dark.
Leaves are starting to rustle in the trees and crunch underfoot.
Soon the rains will come and then the ice and snow.
Winter is coming.
