I'm packing and getting ready for a road trip. After working for many years at one place, my work gives a sabbatical to spend refreshing and preparing for another many years of working. Over the next few weeks, I am packing my family and possessions into a van and driving around America. I will be using my phone to post daily notes from the road as well Twittering in the sidebar.
<p>
We did a similar trip 15 years ago. I found, on an old backup, the web pages I created to record that trip. Check out the original <a href="http://misterblue.com/travel/TripAroundAmerica/">Trip Around America</a>. That's from 1995 so appreciate the hand wrought HTML. Hey, back then the drop shadow on the GIF of America at the top of the page was Hot Stuff.
</p>
<p>
Like I said, I will be posting more as we travel. We'll see how far we get this time -- now the boys are grown and they will have opinions on where we go and what we do.
