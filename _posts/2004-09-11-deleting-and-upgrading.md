I haven't been around much because of work and I've finally returned to the living.  That means the only thing I've been doing to my web site is delete comment spam.  Grumble, grumble.
</p>
<p>
Which leads me to the "upgrading" in the title. 
I tried a whole bunch of tools to close comments, filter comment submission and black list comments but I have been frustrated in all attempts.
My Moveable Type installation is all in PERL and it's hard to debug and impossible to know what's working and not working.
I'd run various scripts and they'd do stuff but, like comments would still be open.  No error messages.  Not log entries.  Nothing.
I've been trying to get a plugin of my own working for a long time but it doesn't work and no one can help ("it works for me") and I'm tired of digging through MT code to find where things are invoked and adding my own debugging logs.
</p>
<p>
So, I'm going to try and get
<a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>
working this weekend and see if that improves things.
I'm more at home with PHP and MySQL and Apache so I'm hoping for
an improvement.
But then, it could be a case of the devil you know vs. the devil you
don't know.  We'll see.
