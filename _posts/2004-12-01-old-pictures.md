<p>
My wife was cleaning out a box and came across some
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/20041201-OldPictures/">old black and white pictures</a>.
"Who are these people", she asked.
"I have no idea, but look at them.  They speak to you", I responded.
</p>
<p>
I love old pictures of people.  Just looking at the faces and bodies of the
people, you see some of their character.
I wonder what became of them.  What they grew into.
I have stood before the camera and had my picture taken and people
will someday look at my image.
Will they see the person in the picture?
