I haven't been updating this much.
Work has been keeping me very busy and I don't feel like sitting down and playing on my home computer after slaving over a hot computer all day.
And I've been working a lot on the
remodel
.
I've finally updated the
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/200303-Remodel/Construction/">construction pictures</a>
although I still need to add some commentary.
</p>
<p>
I've been doing a lot of the finishing work -- painting, trim addition, cleanup and running errands for the contractors. 
I don't need to pay someone else $35 an hour to do that.
</p>
<p>
But I have some more entires to put up here -- I've been taking pictures and have some to blog.
</p>
<p>
And, just as I update this, I have to hit the road for work.
First a few days in
Santa Clara, California.
Then a night at
<a href="http://www.blackbutteranch.com/">Black Butte Ranch</a>
before flying to
Helsinki, Finland
.
I'll have connectivity in Finland so I'll be able to upload pictures from
there.
Stay tuned.
</p>
