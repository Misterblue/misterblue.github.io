<p>
Last night, my son graduated from high school.
He has been attending a
<a href="http://nwacademy.org">small high school</a>
and there were only 18 people in his graduating class.
But, there were many scholorships and people going to prestgious schools,
so the experience of the school was great for him.
</p>
<p>
Now it's off to college for him, but, in the short term,
there was a
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/20050613-Graduation/">celebration</a>
of the four years of work.
