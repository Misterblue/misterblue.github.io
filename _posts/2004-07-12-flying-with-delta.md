<p>
    I am traveling on Delta airlines.
    This has the feel of a very corporately managed,
    bottom-line oriented
    company.
    That is, it is providing just enough service to
    make the maximum amount of money.
</p>
<p>
    This shows up as meals to purchase on the flight
    ($5 to $15 and $2
    snicker doodles
    ),
    complementary drinks but you don't get the can
    and totally automated, bar-coded,
    self-serve-kiosk centric customer interactions.
</p>
<p>
    Someone went in for deeply computerizing the
    system.
    I mentioned the kiosks for self-check-in, but
    the announcements in the waiting lounge are
    computer generated (no unintellegable gate
    attendent announcing over the speakers) and
    large LCD displays put up information on stand-by
    passangers and their status.
    Bar code scanners follow your progress from
    checkin to boarding.
    The database knows all.
</p>
<p>
    I do wonder if some of these automations actually
    save money.
    The generated announcement system, for instance:
    It costs money to install, there must exist a maintance
    crew to repair them, there must be people generating
    the backup  procedures if they fail and there
    are still times that the boarding crew has to make
    announcements so they can't get rid of the old
    system.
    The speech is clearer and the modulated male voice
    is reassuring, but did they save money over the old
    way?
</p>
<p>
    Technology is not the answer to every question.
