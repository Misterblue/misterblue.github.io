A local church (<a href="http://www.ukrainian-orthodox.org/">St. John the Baptist Ukrainian Orthodox Church</a>) which supports the Ukrainian and Polish community here in town, hand makes and sells perogies and other Ukrainian/Polish foods. They do this every Saturday to support the remodel of the church. This Saturday, I took the whole family for food from the old country. <a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/v/20080308-Perogies/">Pictures </a>are available.
