Tonight only my son and I are home and we're having steak and potatoes.
Steak marinated and grilled and baked potatoes with butter and sour
cream.
</p>
<p>
Why the fancy dinner?
Well, I found some steaks in one of the drawers in the frig.  They must
have been left over from a party we had a week and a half ago.
There was a little green/blue color in the liquids under them.
They didn't smell bad and they weren't slimey.
I refered to an article 
<a href="http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/004/T0279E/T0279E03.htm">
Guidelines for slaughtering, meat cutting and further processing
</a>
and decided that we were just at the beginning of bacterial growth.
I'm hoping that maranating and comlete grilling (no "rare" steaks)
will get us through.
</p>
<p>
Wish us luck.
