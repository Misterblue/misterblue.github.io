I spent a few days in Silicon Valley, USA.
The picture to the left is entitled "Sunset over 101".
For those who don't know, "Silicon Valley" streatches from San Jose, California to San Francisco and is the starting point for most of the computer companies (from Atari to Google) with the notable exception of Microsoft.
I could tell I was in California because, of the two vending machines near my hotel room, one sold cans of soda for $1.00 while the other sold bottles of water for $1.50.
And I could tell I was in Silicon Valley because the vending machine in the hotel lobby not only sold the usual toothpaste and snacks but it also sold blank CDs and USB flash memory sticks.

The picture on the right is San Jose from the air.  Millions of people using billions of watts and making computers so I can blog.
