This is my second full day back from the hospital.
I thought I'd be able to sit in front of my computers and type and type -- not hard work, right?
Boy, they tell you'll be fatagued the first week or so and they are  right.
It uses up too much energy to just sit and smile at people.

I did get the 
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/20040101-Heart/">pictures of me in the hospital</a>

An thank you dearly for all the wonderful comments from you people out there -- you are all truely nice people.  Thank you.

<p>
Now I think I'll go take a nap -- all this typing wore me out.
