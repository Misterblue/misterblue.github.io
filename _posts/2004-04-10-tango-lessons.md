    Last night, my son's
    <a href="http://www.nwacademy.org/">school</a>
    presented a set of plays entitled
    <u>Tango Lessons: Three One Act Plays</u>
    .
    They were all written and directed by
    David Wagstaff
    -- one of the teachers at the school.
    They weren't usual "school plays" in that most of
    the actors were professional.
    Two of the actors were students at the school
    and this provided excellent experience for the
    student actors and the technical staff
    (my son did lights and sound).
</p>
<p>
    In the Director's Notes, David Wagstaff relates
    reading an article on the tango
    and the five rules of that dance:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>perfect communication is better than perfect execution</li>
    <li>space between partners keeps them close</li>
    <li>after three dances you have the right to change partners</li>
    <li>you can dance your way out of a corner</li>
    <li>always wear the right shoes</li>
</ol>
<p>
    He continues: "It is the dance we are all born to dance;
    it is the performance of the heart that gives us the
    freedom  to be who and what we are -- passionate, conflicted
    creatures moving to rhythms deep, terrifying and delightful.
    The dance of love."
</p>
<p>
    Do the five rules of the tango relate to your dance?
