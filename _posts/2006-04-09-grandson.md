I haven't been around for a while... taking a 'computer holiday'.
But, while I was away from my computer, real life was going on.
One of the major events was the birth of my first grandson.
I already have a wonderful grand daughter, but now I have one of each.

Congratulations to the new and happy and sleepless parents.
