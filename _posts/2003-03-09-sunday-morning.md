What a wonderful Sunday morning -- spent the time just lying in bed reading.  The window over my bed was open and I could hear the rain and wind of this cool, wet Oregon spring morning.
</p>
<p>
My wife is off at a
<a href="http://www.valleyofthesunmarathon.com">marathon</a> and the kids are sleeping late, so I have the morning to myself.  I finished reading by #15
<a href="http://www.tmcm.com">To Much Coffee Man</a> which is a wonderful and interesting independent 'zine.  For me, it's a look into the independent 'zine publishing world -- the main stream press (and even much of the non-mainstream 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/">tech press</a>
) focuses on what the big guys are doing.
But, behold, the little guys are alive and kicking.
TMCM is an example of a good, non-mainstream paper magazine.
#15 has an interview with Dan Sinker of
<a href="http://www.punkplanet.com">Punk Planet</a>
which is about the non-mainstream music publishers.

Makes a Sunday morning in bed even better knowing the world
isn't all going to pieces -- there are still people out there striving
and going Good Things.
