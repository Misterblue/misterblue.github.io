I've wanted to advance a version but the main thing keeping LookingGlass from being usable was the unbelievable memory footprint. Ogre vertices took up all the memory until it crashed. So, I've spent the last two weeks adding a dynamic loading and unloading system. Now I can log into Wright Plaza and walk an fly around. Woot!!  I'll add a video and some updates this weekend.
