<p>
    It's three days after open-heart, bypass surgery and I'm sitting
    in my chair in my hopsital room waiting for the nurse to come by
    and nag me about walking the halls for exercise.
    Can you believe that?  Just three days ago they stopped my
    heart for 90 minutes so they could add three grafts to repair
    the blood circulation.
</p>
<p>
    Now I'm tired -- a walk around the halls poops me out and I
    take a bit to recover.  It will be several weeks before I'm
    back to almost normal.
</p>
<p>
    I think I will be going home Sunday or Monday, so you should see me
    at my
    <a href="http://www.livingroomcam.us/">desk cam</a>
    soon.
    Take care of your heart.
</p>
