Last Friday I took my son to the airport at 5am. Now, here in Portland, we have a section of Interstate 5 (I5) that runs through the center of town and the speed limit is 55. Since it was 5 in the morning, I decided to move with the prevailing traffic. This meant zipping along at 70 to 75. Whoa!!!! I must say things move quickly in the morning before the cops get out of bed.
