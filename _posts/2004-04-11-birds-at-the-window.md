Last fall, <a href="http://www.misterblue.com/mt/archives/20031012-slave_to_his_instincts.html">
I reported</a>
that a bird was throwing itself against the windows of our bedroom.
Well, this morning, I was awoken by a bird against my window.
</p>
<p>
Last fall, it was a small bird, but now it's a full sized robin.
And this is has been going on for several days.
But there is no sleeping in -- at 6:15am there is tapping and thrashing.
