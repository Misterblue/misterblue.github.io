<p>
This morning, my family was watching old
<a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/sgn/bewitched/">Bewitched</a>
reruns.
In this episode, Endora (Samantha's mother) is introduced to a lady who runs a men's cologne company.
Endora asks, "Why does a woman run a company that makes men's cologne?".
The lady answers "To make money."
</p>
<p>
I smile at this -- a very 90's answer.
</p>
<p>
But then it becomes clear that the rerun is not set in the 90's.
This selfish, blunt answer tells Endora that this person is not a nice person.
So, the rest of the episode has Endora doing her magical tricks to bring
this person down a notch or two.
</p>
<p>
So, my observation for the day is -- what passes these days for savy business
sense, was considered crude, crass and inhuman just a few decades ago.
