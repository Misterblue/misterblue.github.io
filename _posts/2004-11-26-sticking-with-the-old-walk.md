    times,  I am aware of what they speak.
    Tomorrowland is becoming more and more like the uninspired
    new lands that the corporation has built.
    California Adventure at Disneyland and the
    Disney Studio at Disneyland Paris are dull, lifeless and
    just not interesting to visit.
    Let alone having to pay piles of dollars to get in.
</p>
<p>
    Part of me, though, is facinated by the battle between the
    people who want to keep Disney Disney and those who are
    making it into a modern, bottom-line, soul-less but profitable
    company.
    I have read several of the autobiographies on Walt Disney
    and I have come to the conclusion that, if he hadn't died,
    the company would be a lot different then the movie and
    amusement park company that most of the 'old timers' wish.
    Walt was passionate about his next ideas.
    First they were animated movies, then they were about
    the parks and his next project was changing how
    <a href="http://www.waltopia.com/">
        communities are created and how people live
    </a>
    .
    If you've ever road the train around Fantasy Land in
    Disneyworld, you'd know that Walt-the-perfectionist
    was not focusing on the rebuilding of his last project.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I cheer the 'make it like the old times' people.
I especially liked the idea that the 
<a href="http://www.macobserver.com/article/2004/10/29.4.shtml">best replacement for Eisner is Steve Jobs</a>.
Now there is a fellow that is creative and can lead a creative company
and can lead a technical company.
That would be an interesting change.
