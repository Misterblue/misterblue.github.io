I mentioned that I drive to spend one night with my family
between jaunts out of town.  This morning, I left Black
Butte at 10am to get to the airport for my flight.
</p>
<p>
Black Butte is one of those holiday resorts where the
lower upper -class go to play.  We're talking homes that
cost more than good homes in the big city.  My parents
ended up with a condo there because my father organized
their bridge group to go together and buy a condo there
when it was just being built.  Prices have risen enough
to where we couldn't afford to buy the condo today.
</p>
<p>
I had to go a different way to get to Portland because
the usual highway was closed because of fires.  In fact,
Black Butte Ranch was on Phase 2 pre-evaculation status
so my family had everything packed so they could throw
everything into the car and be off at any moment.
</p>
<p>
This meant the area was full of smoke, also.  Normally,
from the Ranch
you can see several snow covered mountain peaks set against
blue sky,
but this week you were lucky to see the trees on the other
side of the golf course.
</p>
<p>
So the drive back to the big city smelled of smoke and
the views were limited.  I drove over to Redmond, up
through Madras,
through the
Hot Springs Indian Reservation
(and past a few casinos, of course),
through
Government Camp
and past
Timberline Lodge
and finally down to the big city.
