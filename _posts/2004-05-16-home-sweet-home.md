<p>
Finally home from England.
It will be good to spend a night in my own bed.
I put the rest of my
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/20040510-England/">pictures</a>
up and tomorrow I'll annotate and organize a bit.
But, for the moment, I have to go to bed -- I've been travelling
for near 20 hours straight with no sleep.
