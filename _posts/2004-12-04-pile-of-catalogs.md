I live in a zip code that is targetted by catalog companies.
We get piles and piles of catalogs.
I keep claiming that, if I had the right fireplace, I could heat the house
with all the catalogs we receive.

Well, since June, I have been recording every catalog received at my home.
Check out the
<a href="http://misterblue.com/catalog/">catalog accounting</a>
page. 
We're up to 364 catalogs in the last 148 days.
That's  about 2.5 catalogs a day!!!
I figure that's a pile about 5 feet high.
For my one home.
Think how many catalogs that must be for the whole neighborhood?
