<p>
It's been a while since my last post.
I haven't had another
heart attack
or anything disasterous like that.
It's more that work has been busy and I've moved my web server from the old 300MHz hand-me-down computer runner Redhat 7.3 
to a newer 1.0 GHz hand-me-down computer running
Fedora Core 2.
The transition hasn't been without hickups and that has been keeping me busy.

But, I'm back.  Hi all!!!!
