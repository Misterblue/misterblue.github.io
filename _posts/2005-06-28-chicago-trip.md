    I'm travelling to Chicago this week.
    It is hot, humid and hazy.
    I'm on the Miracle Mile but I can't see very far up the
    street.
    I'm on the top floor of my hotel but I can't see a quarter
    mile from here.
    I'm skipping the trip to the observitory on top of the
    Hancock Tower because I just wouldn't see any view.
    All of the locals are complaining about the heat in June.
    Global warming is a pain.

    I did walk around the neighborhood I'm in.
    There are many residential buildings here and a lot of people
    on the street.
    People from the burbs are always afraid of 'downtown',
    but the part of Chicago around the Hancock tower is
    very clean and pleasent.

    It is a little expensive for my tastes.  If you can't read
    picture at the left is says "Elegent Homes priced from
    $1.5m".  These are "homes" that are in a several story
    building on the shore of Lake Michigan, but still, I'm sure
    the "starting at" homes are on the non-lake veiw, setting
    sun side of the building.  And a deal at only 1.5 million.

    This part of Chicago is shopping crazy.
    Most of the buildings around here have several floors of
    shops.  These are all upscale mall stores that cater to
    the people who can afford the 1.5 million dollar
    residences around here.
    Shops range from coffie shops to a Bentley automobile showroom.
    The Hershey's shop shown at the left was very disappointing.
    Since I really like chocolate, I check out the shop and
    thought I could find things is the special Hershey's shop.
    I expected to find a special dark chocolate the can only
    be found at the you-have-to-go-to-Chicago shop.
    Saddly, the only thing they sold here was packaged
    chocolate that you could purchase anywhere else in the nation.
    Another company making a little marketing mistake.
