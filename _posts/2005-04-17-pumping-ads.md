    You people in the rest of the United States probably won't
    believe it, but, here in Oregon, we don't pump our own gas.
    Yes, we sit in our car and a trained Fuel Technician puts
    the gas in our cars.
    In fact, it is illegal for people to pump their own gas.
</p>
<p>
    On my
    <a href="http://www.misterblue.com/wwpp/archives/20050413-college-visits">trip to New York</a>
    ,
    I had to refill the rental car and there, on the pump
    handle was an ad.
    Service stations are getting like athletic stadiums:
    every flat surface is covered with advertisements
    (although, stadiums have most things beat with those
    rotating ad panels so they can get more than one
    ad on a surface.)
</p>
<p>
    And this gas station ad wasn't for a gas additive or
    similar.  It was for spam software.
    Just what I'm thinking of when I'm pumping gas.
