    Oh my, I just got home from dinner at my parents house and am I stuffed! I had the infamous "just one more bite and that's all" syndrom happening tonight. =) Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family. Oh yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing the ChristmasCam! =)

Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!!
</p>

We've already done the
<a href="http://www.orrc.net/Docs/Races/Turkey_Trot/">Turkey Trot</a>
(a four miler from the zoo to the Rose Garden and back)
and I've mashed the potatoes for Thanksgiving day dinner at Grandma's.
Pictures will be up tonight.

Don't eat too much.
