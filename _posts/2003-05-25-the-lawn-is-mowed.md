    See? The satisfaction of a job well done! Now I wish I had tried harder to mow the back, too because it's cold and raining today!

I was sitting there reading blogs and prograstinating doing yard work when I ran across 
<a href="http://www.sugar-plum.net/elizabeth/">Busy Mom</a>'s entry saying how much
<a href="http://sugar-plum.net/elizabeth/archives/002906.html#002906"> 
she enjoys mowing the lawn</a>
and she even included a picture of her completed job.
</p>
<p>
Sigh.  I guess I should do my lawn... and here is a picture of my completed mow.
Maybe this Memorial Day weekend, everyone that mows a lawn should put up a picture of their mowing.  Celebrate suburbia in this great land.
