    Ahhhhhh yes....always someone to the rescue with the right name of whatever.  I have a friend who can ID anything on the planet, I swear.  (and, she's RIGHT!) I have some books, but I dont think I'll ever know them all.  But now, you know *one more thing* (smile) Nice pictures, I could easily feel at home there.

A quick day trip to the beach.
              I hadn't walked on the beach in a long time so
              I suggested just driving over there and doing
              just that.
              We went to
              <a href="http://www.cannon-beach.net/">Cannon Beach</a>
              where the much photographed
              Haystack Rock is located.
          </p>
          <p>
              Men of War jelly fish had washed up on the beach
              so the high water line was covered with the
              little blue jelly fish.
              It was also low tide so the area around Haystack Rock
              was exposed showing off mussels, barnicles,
              anenomies, starfish and crabs.

As was pointed out by
<a href="http://www.misterblue.com/mt/mt-comments.cgi?__mode=red&amp;id=215">pril</a>,
what I was taught when I was a kid was wrong -- the small blue
jelly fish are not "Man o' War", but are really
<a href="http://morro-bay.com/docents/curt-beebe/velella/">"By-the-wind Sailor"</a> or "Velella velella"
<a href="http://jellieszone.com/velella.htm">(Phylum Cnidaria/Class Hydrozoa/Order Anthomedusae/Family Velellidae)</a>.
They are similar to the 
<a href="http://www.earthwindow.com/zoo.html">Portuguese Man-of-War</a>.
Live and learn.
