I haven't been on much as you might tell -- I've been
under the gun at work (BIG project  with lots of visibility)
and our renters moved out.
</p>
<p>
The latter is  what's been keeping me off the computer the most.
The last few weeks we completely repainted the house (ceilings
and walls), re-installed linolium, replaced all the light and plumbing
fixtures and cleaned, cleaned, cleaned.
What a lot of work.
</p>
<p>
I will now have my evenings back and can spend some time
on the computer.  And with my blog.
