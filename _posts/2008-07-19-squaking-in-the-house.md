For this warm weather, I open up the house in the morning to let the cool night air in. I open windows and the door to the patio. This morning, the quiet of a Saturday morning at home was interrupted with chirping and tweeting and thumping from the living room. I ran out there to find one frightened and frantic bird flying around the living room with a cat in close pursuit.
<p>
There is a happy ending to this story. The bird flew behind the stereo speaker in the corner of the room and I grabbed the cat and got her out of the way. A dish towel thrown over the bird allowed me to pick it up and take it outside where it flew off into the trees.
</p>
<p>
Now, a few hours after the excitement, all of the cats in the house are still looking around the living room for the bird. They can smell it.
