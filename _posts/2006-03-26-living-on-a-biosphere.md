<p>
It's a sunday night and I'm sitting here doing computer work, but when I take off my headphones I can hear the night birds calling.  It's spring and the animals are calling to each other.  It's different than the media message or the jets flying into the airport. There is life in the air. The call of the owls puntuates a dark night. My heart, which is not truely filled by the latest pop hit, smiles at the sound of an owl calling.

Spring is here. Turn off your streaming radio feed and listen to the night. 
Your true self is there.
