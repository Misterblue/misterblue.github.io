Never said being a policeman was easy.  This weeks local reports include the following sure-to-be-on "Cops" items:
<ul>
<li>
A dead squirrel was found in the roadway near the intersection of Knaus Road and Timberline Drive.
</li>
<li>
A resident received a suspicious piece of mail.
</li>
<li>
A McVey/South Shore area resident says someone cut a coupon out of the coupons she received in the mail.
</li>
<li>
A resident of  the Springbrook Park neighborhood called police to report that
her ex-husband was at her house, intoxicated, and planning to
eat a live lobster as part of some kind of satanic ritual.
Police were unable to contact the woman, but met with the ex-husband
in question.
No word on the lobster.
</li>
