Some observations:<ul>
<li>
For an American, this place is VERY expensive – the exchange rate of 1.75 dollars US to one pound makes everything from postcards to pints rather dear;
</li>
<li>
Light switches are pushed on the top to turn off and pushed on the bottom to turn on;
</li>
<li>
I had a dinner named “Bangers and mash”.  Other fun foods are available;
</li>
<li>
The "first floor" is the second floor of a building -- the one at street level is called the ground floor and the one above that is called the first floor;
</li>
<li>
The light switches and power outlets are not in bathrooms -- building codes don't allow it;
</li>
<li>
The pubs are the place to hang out.  Always full and very lively.
</li>
</ul>

I also have some

up.
More to come.
