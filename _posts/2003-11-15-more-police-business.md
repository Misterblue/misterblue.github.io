Ths week's community newspaper came and I purused
the "Public Safety" section to see what the miscreants
were up to in our neigborhood.
</p>
<p>
It looks like someone is having too much fun with
these police reports.
I
<a href="http://www.misterblue.com/mt/archives/20031109-police_business.html">
listed a few
</a>
from the last weeks but here are some, uneditted
and just as they appeared in the newspaper
<i>
[with a few comments from me added]
</i>
.
I am not making this up.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    A woman reported missing by her husband
    came home.  She was out shopping.
    </li>
    <li>
    A man contacted at Westlake Park was not smoking marijuana as
    origionally reported, just plain ol' ordinary cigarettes.
    </li>
    <li>
    A Tri-Met bus driver called police to
    report the man who helped him fix the fare
    box using an eight-inch hunting knife
    as "suspicious".
    Reports suggested the driver did not
    consider the man threatening.

    helping out. --MB]
    </i>
    </li>
    <li>
    Police took a call from a man claiming he
    came home to find 10 people camped out in
    his house.
    The man retracted his story after taking
    his medication and realizing he'd
    imagined the whole thing.

    </i>
    </li>
    <li>
    <i>
        [This is exactly as it appears in
        the paper. --MB]
    </i>
    A Dumpster fire was reported at the
    Luscher Farm dog park.
    The Dumpster is provided for the disposal
    of ... ew, gross.
    </li>
</ul>
