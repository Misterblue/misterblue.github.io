Most of the day proper was spent inside a building.  But, at the end of the day, we all set off for our "social gathering" which was dinner in the old customs house.
</p>
<p>
I took the tram (electric trolly) down to the market area and walked through downtown Helsinki to our dinner.  The street musicians were just setting up.  The three I ran across were a pan-pipe musician, a pair of ladies with a cello and violin and a tall fellow who was an operatic tenor.  Beats a guitar or saxaphone.
</p>
<p>
Our dinner started at 8pm and included what was essentially a drinking game that had external facilitators organizing the activity.  We broke up into teams and we each had to identify several containers of liquids (alcoholic, fruit juices and pop) and then make a punch out of them.  We then had to make up a story around the punch and then present the skit/song/poem/... to the rest of the group.  My rap performance took first prize.  LOL.
</p>
<p>
Well, I didn't get out of the party until midnight.  I didn't know it was that late and it took me a while to realize that my tram wasn't running any more that night.  So I walked back to the hotel across Helsinki.  It's not like I was alone either.  The bars and pubs were still hopping and people were walking on the streets.  I didn't get into bed until 2am.

Tomorrow I'll do some sight seeing and take pictures.  Blog you then.
