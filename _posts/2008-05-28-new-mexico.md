We are in Taos, New Mexico tonight -- an upscale artist's town who's central area is awash in galleries.  Most of today was driving across Colorado from Durango. This meant some time in tree covered mountains as we crossed the continental divide. We got up to 10,000 feet before again dropping down into the desert.
<p>
I have some pictures from the last few days up -- that part takes a while to upload. I also have many, many panoramas to put together when I get back home. I have included some of the individual pictures for the panoramas some of the time because some of the views are amazing. There are now pictures up for <a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/v/20080500-Trip/20080526-NaturalBridges/">Natural Bridges National Monument</a>, <a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/v/20080500-Trip/20080526-NewspaperRock/">Newspaper Rock</a>, <a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/v/20080500-Trip/20080526-MonumentValley/">Monument Valley</a>, <a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/v/20080500-Trip/20080526-FourCorners/">Four Corners</a> and <a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/v/20080500-Trip/20080527-MesaVerde/">Mesa Verde National Park</a>.

I'm missing everyone. Hope you are enjoying the progress and the pictures. Tomorrow, its off to Texas.
