<p>
We were awoken at 6:30am by our
<a href="http://www.misterblue.com/mt/archives/20040411-birds_at_the_window.html">window bird</a>.
This robin has been tapping at our window every morning.
It starts sometime between 6 and 7am and goes until I don't know when.
</p>
<p>
We've tried taping up cutouts of cats on the outside of the windows.
We've tried changing the look of the shades inside.
The only thing that seems to dissuade the bird is to move the shades.
This causes it to fly off for 30 minutes or so before returning to continue the
attack on the windows.
</p>
<p>
I guess there is no sleeping in late until this bird finds something better to do.
