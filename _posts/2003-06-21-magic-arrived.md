Harry Potter arrived!
There on our doorstop when we got back from the half marathon was a box. 
A FedEx two day Saturday delivery box.
The Harry preorder had arrived.  That must have been quite a contract for FedEx and they must have hired extra people.  Quite a job to just get a book out on Saturday.
