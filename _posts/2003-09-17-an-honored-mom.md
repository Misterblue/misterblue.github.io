Last night I escorted my mother to a dinner where she was receiving
and award.
The dinner turned out to be the annual dinner of the
<a href="http://www.legacyhealth.org/findus/hospitals/gshmc/gshmc.ssi">Good Samaritan Hospital</a>
Foundation.
Good Sam is the hospital that's in the middle of downtown so, given the sort of people they get for a foundation, I spent  the evening with the old money of Portland -- name tags had names that are on buildings in this town.

Anyway, my mother received her recognition as a
"Treasure of Good Samaritan" for her 30+ years of volunteer
work.
The other honorees were the Episcopal bishop of Oregon and
a doctor how has lead woman's cradiac research and care for years.
This should give you some idea of the honor.
Good work mother.
