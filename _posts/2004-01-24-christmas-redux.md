Last evening I had all my kids over for dinner.
The real occasion was for my daughter to open her Christmas presents
since she was out of town on Christmas day.
The plan was to have her and her husband over around New Years but
<a href="http://www.misterblue.com/mt/archives/20040104-back_luck_with_the_ticker.html">other things</a>
came up.
So, she finally got to open her presents at the end of January.

of the eating and  the opening are available.
Better late then never.
