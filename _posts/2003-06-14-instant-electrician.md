The plaster board fellows showed up at 7am this Saturday morning to finish nailing plaster to the walls and ceilings.
As we were about to leave to run, my wife mentions that she wanted two lights on each side of the bathroom sink rather than just one overhead.   Oopppssss.

So a quick trip to the hardware store and some wiring and hammering and trying to stay ahead of the plasterers.  Now there are two but it didn't make up for missing my morning run.  I'll have to run tomorrow morning.  So much for sleeping in.
