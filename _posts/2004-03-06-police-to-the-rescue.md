    Is this Lake O? Ha--my wife and I get a big chuckle out of the weekly blotter in the Review. I bet they pulled out ALL the fancy police equipment when those kids busted into Lakeridge High last fall!

    There was not much interesting listed under the
    "Public Safety" section of our local town paper,
    but it looks like the police were called a few
    times for very serious occurances.
    How do they train for all this stuff?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A sick raccoon was reported under the porch
        in the 17500 block of Schalit Way.
    </li>
    <li>
        A large dead squirrel was removed from the roadway
        on the 1000 block of C Avenue.
    </li>
    <li>
        Responding to a report of
        "blood all over the kitchen walls",
        a police officer found, instead,
        cranberry juice all over the walls.
    </li>
</ul>
