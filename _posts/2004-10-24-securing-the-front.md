I'm still finding my way around <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.  I think I have all my content and comments moved over from <a href="http://moveabletype.org/">Moveable Type</a>.  I origionally decided to move because I kept getting PILES of comment spam and they didn't have the tools I needed and, since I'm not a PERL wizard, I needed something I could hack on.  PHP is more my cup of tea.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I finally installed <a href="http://theubergeeks.net/2004/08/25/optional-comment-moderation-03/">comment moderation</a>  plugin and cleaned out the latest round of online poker playing spam.  Sigh.

Now I'm on a program of finding security tools to manage my Linux system.  So how can I be sure my system hasn't been rooted?  Even though I have a firewall and I don't read mail on the server machine, there are many bad things out there and many scary stories.  The Internet used to be so easy.
