<p>
I've been playing with other blog sites.
Keeping my own site up is becoming a drag -- always updating because of  bugs and exploits, sigh.
I've checked out MySpace and <a href="http://360.yahoo.com/misterblue/">Yahoo</a> but I'm not totally happy with anything.
I wouldn't mind letting someone else handle the administration so I can just worry about content.
I wonder what I'll decide.
