          My son is growing up and it is getting to be time to
          go off to college.
          Part of this ritual is visiting colleges and getting
          the vib of the campus -- one doesn't want to spend
          a year living somewhere one hates.

              So, this weekend, we travelled to New York and
              visited
              <a href="http://www.rit.edu/">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>
              ("RIT")
              and
              <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>
              ("RPI").
              You can tell my son is into engineering.
