y.html">
        before
    </a>
    ,
    the local, small town paper reports the last week's police business.
    Some of the entries from last week were:
    <ul>
        <li>
            A woman was bitten by a dog at Palisades Market,
            which was probably only fair since she'd just
            hit him with her car.
        </li>
        <li>
            You, the woman who walks the blond lab at Westlake
            on weekday mornings --
            someone is going to call the police the next time
            she sees you with the dog off leash.
        </li>
        <li>
            A house was doused with shaving cream and toilet paper.
            Tis is apparently the second time this has happened,
            and presumably has something to do with the
            teenage daughter living there.
        </li>
        <li>
            A woman was reported driving around First Addition,
            yelling as she drove, "Does anyone want to buy a car?".
            Police located  the woman, who does indeed have
            a car for sale.
        </li>
        <li>
            A resident of Pointe apartments -- who had apparently
            been drinking -- reported that the coffee man
            has placed a bomb in her apartment.
        </li>
        <li>
            An individual was cited for excessive noise
            emanating from his drums.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    And, as always, this is exactly as it appreared in the paper.
</p>
<p>
    And, very saddly, two of the reports were of young women
    (12 and 14) attempting suicide.
    Very sad.
