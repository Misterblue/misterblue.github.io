<p>
    From the air, the area around the airport is full of
    large houses either in developments or in farms.
    The developments are large with lots at least an acre.
    The level of prosperity here in
    Northern Kentucky
    and southern Ohio is amazing.
    There are always
    haves
    and
    have-nots
    ,
    but there are an amazing number of "haves" here
    and they are doing pretty well in their 4000+
    square foot homes with swimming pool in the back.
