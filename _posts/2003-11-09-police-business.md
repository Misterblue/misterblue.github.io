    I like the 'public safety' section. It makes me laugh. =) Thanks!!

Our local community newspaper prints a "public
safety" section which lists the week's DUIs,
car breakins and other police incidents.
Well, it's clear that police work is not all
car chases and high tension stake outs from
these police incidents I've collected the last three weeks:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Police helped a woman retrieve her
    keys from underneath the seat in her car.
    </li>
    <li>
    A concerned citizen reported a man on the
    sidewalk holding his head.
    Police reponded and found the man talking
    on a cell phone.
    </li>
    <li>
    An employee of the Indoor Tennis Center
    called to report a leaky toilet in the men's room.
    </li>
    <li>
    Two people found laying on the railroad
    tracks near Summit Driver were told not
    to do such things.
    </li>
    <li>
    Reports of a glowing orange apparition in the
    dog park on Stafford proved to be unfounded --
    just a light held by a dog walker.
    </li>
    <li>
    The intoxicated driver reported at
    Lakeridge High School was actually
    a person learning how to drive.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
As

would say, I'm not making this up.
