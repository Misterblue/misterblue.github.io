A British view from the 
Guardian Unlimited on
<a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,919987,00.html">How to Save the Brand America</a>.
Even our friends have some questions about our motives.

Interesting
<a href="http://www.aeronautics.ru/index.htm">reports on the war in Iraq</a>
proported to be from the Russion
GRU
over at 
Venik's Aviation.  I don't have a clue how real they are but they are  more or less accurate and they provide a different view.

<p>
And Christopher Allbritton is in Turkey and trying to get into Iraq as an independent, "blog journalist".
Check out his entries at
<a ref="http://www.back-to-iraq.com/">Back to Iraq 2.0</a>.
If you're really keen at supporting  the independence if the Internet
(a opposed to it's slow assimilation by the Big Guys)
support Christopher by 
sending money
.
