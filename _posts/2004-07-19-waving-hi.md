<p>
So why is it that in some towns people say "hi" to strangers while in other towns they don't?
</p>
<p>
I was out jogging the other day and noticed that everyone I went by looked at me and said "hi" or "good morning".
Couples walking together, single men, single women, people on bikes all greeted me as I ran.
</p>
<p>
I've been in other towns where no one -- and I mean no one -- looked at me let alone said anything.  
I've been in resorts or nice neighborhoods where people look straight ahead and do their best to not acknowledge my existance.
</p>
<p>
It seems to be characteristic of the place.
Why is that?
