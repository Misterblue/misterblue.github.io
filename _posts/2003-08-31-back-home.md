<p>
I'm back home from the
<a href="http://www.oregonstarparty.org/">Star Party</a>.
Just think of 1000 people camped in the desert with hundreds of telescopes, seminars on the universe and lots of dust.
We saw planets (Mars prominent), nebulas, clusters, globules and galaxies.

I'm posting this from home but I could have posted a message from the desert.
One vendor had a truck full of computers and a satellite link. 
We had wireless internet in the middle of the desert!!
It's everywhere.
