I was cleaning up some of the remodel yesterday when I heard this odd knocking sound in the master bedroom.
It kept happening intermittantly so I want to investigate.
What I found was a small bird flying from the tree and pecking at one of the windows.
Odd, I thought.

The next day I'm working on the porch and, "peck, peck", I hear it again. 
The bird is now pecking at the window and at the mirrors on the cars parked in the driveway.
I can only figure that his instincts are to beat up other birds of his type to clear the territory for winter.
The poor little guy is getting carried away.
