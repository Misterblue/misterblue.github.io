Woke up this morning to white stuff on the ground. It's always iffy whether the weather report will be correct -- too often they predict but the snow doesn't come. The temperature is expected to get up to 40 this afternoon, so the snow will only stick around long enough to mess up the commute. This evening, though, it will get back down below freezing. I might have to work from home today.
