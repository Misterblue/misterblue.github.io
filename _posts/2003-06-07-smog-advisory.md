Smog advisory in Portland in early June!!! What's that all about?
I grew up in this town and have enjoyed the gray skies and the trees and the green and the weather.
But this year, we've started the summer off with 100 degree weather and smog!!!  We don't get smog here!! 
At least, we didn't used to.

Too many people have moved here.  It's time to move farther north.
