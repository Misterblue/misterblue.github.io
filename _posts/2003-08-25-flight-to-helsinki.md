The Luftanza flight to Helsinki was long.  Or at least it seems that
way since I haven't had much sleep the last 24 hours.
We were served a light meal of cheese, pasta and meat.
Very good.
But the most interesting points (as least to an American) is
that they actually served the meal with metal utensils - yes,
an actual metal fork and knife.
You'll not find that anywhere in America.

Helsinki is the place to go for conferences.
Well, all of Europe seems to be -- I even met someone I knew
who was going to
SIGCOMM
.
The lady I sat next to on the flight to Helsinki was going
to a geophysics conference and there is the look of amny of
the people on this plane -- there are a lot of English
as first language people on this plane.
