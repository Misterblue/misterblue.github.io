This morning I ran 6 miles in 
<a href="http://www.runwithpaula.com/PintsToPasta.htm">Pasta to Pints</a>
(beer and pasta at the end -- a reason to run!!).
Yesterday I ran 8 miles around my neighborhood.
That's a lot of running for one weekend especially when I'm
tapering for the
Portland Marathon in two weeks.
I'll have to take care of my body for the next two weeks.

Unfortunately, I forgot my camera rushing to get out of the house
so you don't have pictures of another sunny summer day
in downtown Portland.
Wait, I wasn't supposed to tell you about that.
It rains here all the time.  That's right.
Rain, rain, rain and gray sky.
And the slugs -- you have to pick them off your car in the morning.
No one would ever like to move here.  Never.  ;-)
