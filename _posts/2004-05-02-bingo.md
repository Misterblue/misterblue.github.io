    The basic buyin is $6 for all of the standard games.  Then there are the specials and bonus games that come between the regular games.  That adds up to about $25.  Of course, you don't want to sit there and play just one game. :-))

Last night I spent the evening playing Bingo.
Not something I'd normally do, but my wife and my daughter 
asked me to go with them on an evening of dabbing and
munching.
In a large room 
(a glass wall separating the smokers from the
non-smokers and there were more smokers than
non-smokers) we sat at fold up tables with our large sheets
of numbers with our little dabbers.
Yes, you buy these ink dabbers that make a circle of ink 
on the page.  These come in many colors with sparkles, pastels
and people have nicely crafted bags for carrying them around.
</p>
<p>
We bought our pads of the regular games,  the specials and
the bonus games.
Then numbers were called and numbers were dabbed.
I actually did pretty well by winning one bingo early in one
of the games.
That was $44 for me!!
</p>
<p>
I thought the most interesting feature was that this 
bingo parlor was not a private business but is run by the state.
Oregon is a state the runs lotteries and bingo palors.
This means that it's main business is running the lottery and not
squeezing that extra $10  or $20 dollars from every customer.
Thus is wasn't like going to a movie theatre -- 
the food at the snack bar was reasonable, 
the cokes in the coke machine were only 50 cents
and people brought their own food in.
