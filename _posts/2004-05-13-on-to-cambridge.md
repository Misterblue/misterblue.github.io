  content: "I used to hang out in Cambridge when I lived in Bury St. Edmunds (east of you). Do they still have the Saturday market on Wednesday?    \n\nThat's one of the best towns to walk in, and one of the worst to drive, if you get lost easily.\n\nHave some mushy peas for me.  Might be a good break from the pints!"

    I took some pictures of the market on Saturday.  Check out the picture page.  It was also on Wednesday but someone said it was there most days of the week.  And, yes, many pints were drunk.

My
<a href="http://www.cambridge.crowneplaza.com/">hotel</a>
is right in the middle of the college district.
The view out my window is of the zoology library and, while
getting ready for bed, my view out the window is of racks
and racks of books throught the windows across the street
with a few diligent students studying.
</p>
<p>
    This morning, I started in Bristol and rode the train
    to Paddington Station in London.
    Then a trip on the
    <a href="http://tube.tfl.gov.uk/">Underground</a>
    to
    Kings Cross Station.
    I boarded the train to Cambridge on platform 9b
    (not 9 3/4 for all you Potter fans).
</p>
<p>
     The smooth hour trip from London to Cambridge and a
     taxi ride to the hotel and soon I was out exploring
     the streets.
     I walked around the colleges and took pictures
     of the churches
     and people punting on the river.
     I had dinner and a pint in The Eagle pub.
     Then I ran into come colleges and
     we had to go out for another pint and a another
     pub.
</p>
<p>
    Once I get some real network connectivity, I'll
    get some pictures up.
