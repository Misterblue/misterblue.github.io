I live in a fairly large city (a few million people) so we don't consider Portland, Oregon too far out in the boonies, but this
<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=578&ncid=578&e=3&u=/nm/20030614/ts_nm/life_boat_dc">story on Yahoo</a>
tells of a tragic boating accident off the Oregon coast.  But the byline is for Palo Alto, California
and, although the accident happened near Tillamook Oregon
(think
<a href="http://www.tillamookcheese.com/">cheese</a>
),
the article reports it as "near" Portland and then even has a picture
of Oregon in relation to Washington state
so readers can know this little piece of geography.

I guess Oregon is the boonies.
