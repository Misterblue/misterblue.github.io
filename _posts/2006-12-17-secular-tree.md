Disney has an illuminated Tinkerbell for the top of your Christmas tree. That strikes me as truly a secular Christmas -- taking even the angel from the tree. Now, the tree itself is a pagen symbol but making it the center of the family with the angel looking over adds a little of the true Christmas spirit. But, adding Tinkerbell is going over to the commercial side much too far. Don't you think?
