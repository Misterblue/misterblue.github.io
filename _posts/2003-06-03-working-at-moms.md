    Great house! I saw your b-day of July 12th, that's the same as Busy Boy's!

My mom is getting older so, every now and then, her boys spend a day at her house working on the yard do all of those things that a 70+ year old lady can't. 
This last Sunday was one of those days.
The 
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/20030601-Moms/">results are kind of nice</a>.
</p>
<p>
The house she's living in was built by my great-grandmother about 70 years ago.  Big rooms and built solid.  My mom is getting ready to move out leaving the rest of the family to wonder if we're going to let it go out of the family.
A question asked my many a family.
