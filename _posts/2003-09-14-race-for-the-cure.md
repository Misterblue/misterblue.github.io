<p>
This morning I joined 40,000 woman (and a few men) in 
Portland's 12'th annual
<a href="http://www.raceforthecure-pdx.org">Race For the Cure</a>.
With the drone of news helicoptors overhead, 
I ran the coed 5K with my wife in memory of 
<a href="http://www.misterblue.com/Adele/">her mother</a>
who died of cancer a few years ago.
</p>
<p>
A great turnout for a good cause.
