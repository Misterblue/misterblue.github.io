One of the many things I did this weekend was varnish wood.
The windows in the bathrooms needed to be varnished to keep the
wet out and there are some cabinets on the back deck that needed
weatherizing.

I also did the ceiling of the
porch.
A little architectural detail added by the architect.
The porch is starting to look really good.
