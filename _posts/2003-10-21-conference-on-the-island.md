<p>
The conference I am at is
<a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/sosp2003/">SOSP2003</a>
that was held at the
<a href="http://www.thesagamore.com/">Sagamore Hotel</a>
that is situated on an island in beautiful
<a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?ed=M7tNO.p_0TqT&csz=Bolton%2C+NY&country=us">Lake George</a>
.
The Sagamore is an resort for people from New York who come north
to lie by the lake or otherwise enjoy the countryside.
A definite tourist resort area.
