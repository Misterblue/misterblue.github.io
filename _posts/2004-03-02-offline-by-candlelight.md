Last night this site was offline for about 4 hours.
The family was scattered about the house  when the lights
went off at about 6pm.
Soon, we were all together in the kitchen lighting candles and fixing
dinner on the gas stove.
We had dinner by candle light and finished the evening by
playing Uno.  (It's hard to tell  the difference between green and
blue with just the light of a few candles.)

The power returned at 10pm after my son took a shower by candle light.
We could now all go off to our separate rooms and finish the
evening by the steady shine of electric light.
