    How about molehills?  We have molehills! :)

    They're not quite as chancy.  Stay safe.

A few weeks ago, a report 
<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/04/29/volcano.danger.ap/">
hit the news</a>
on the U.S. Geological Survey report on lack of monitoring of U.S. volcanos.
Most of the new reports focused on the fact that Yosemite moved up to
number 26 in the list of volcanos most likely to do something.
</p>
<p>
Well, I read the report and I did notice that, for me, the real news was that the
top four volcanos in the U.S. that are most likely to do something are Mt St Helens, Mt Rainier, Mt Hood and South Sisters.  These are all mountains you can see on a clear day from here in Portland.
</p>
<p>
It adds a little interest having volcanos in your yard.
