I am sitting in the Dulles airport on my way to England.  I have a week long business trip that will take me to Bristol and Cambridge.  Sadly I wonâ€™t have much time to sight see with most of the whole days taken up with either traveling from old place to another or in meetings.  I plan to take pictures of what I find and send them over.  Stay tuned.
