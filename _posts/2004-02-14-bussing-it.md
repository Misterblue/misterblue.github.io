    Since the
    <a href="http://www.misterblue.com/mt/archives/20040113-more_recovering.html
">operation</a>
    ,
    they haven't been letting me drive.
    Well, next week I'll be an American again. :-)
    In the mean time,
    I've been discovering the city's
    <a href="http://www.trimet.org/">bus system</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Monday I went downtown to do some Valentine's Day shopping.
    On Wednesday, I took the bus to one side of town for a
    doctor appointment and then I took the bus and  train to the
    other side of town to pick up a book where I work.
    That's two errands in one day.
    People with cars  think they can get 10 errands done
    in one day.
    That's not a human pace of life.
    Buses are much more casual.

There are a few
<a href="http://pics.misterblue.com/20040209-Bus/">pictures</a>
of my travels.
