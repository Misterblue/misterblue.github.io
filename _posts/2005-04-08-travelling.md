  content: COOL!  Digital media from a vending machine.  That has to be one of the best ideas I've ever heard of.  Hooray for instant gratification!

I haven't been making any blog entries because work has been driving me crazy and I have been travelling a bunch recently.
Monday through Wednesday of this week, I was in Palo Alto, California.
Deep in Silicon Valley.
As proof, I present the picture at left which shows that, along with the chips and candy bars, the hotel vending machine included flash memory and blanks CDs.

The rest of the week, I'm flying to the east coast to accompany my son on visits to universities.
He is a high school senior and next year he (and piles of my money) leave the nest.
I'll post some updates as we travel.
