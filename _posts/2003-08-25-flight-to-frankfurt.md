There is more smoking in the Frankfurt airport than in any
place in the States.
There are smoking areas but they are inside.  I didn't find
the smoke oppresive but it was definitely more than most
Americans are used to these days.

There didn't seem to be a lot of that anal security that we're
getting in the States.  I had my passport checked once
in Frankfurt (and that was to get into the security area
and not getting on the plane) and I didn't see a single armed
soldger type hanging around.  In Frankfurt, air travel is pretty
much the way it used to be before 9/11.
