<p>
Just finished my Saturday morning run (only 9 miles).
The
Portland Marathon
is only four weekends away!!!
</p>
<p>
One of the nice things about these cool, damp fall mornings is the
hot air balloons.
You see them hanging in the sky in the west after sunrise.
I don't know what it is, but they make me smile just seeing them
floating silently and slowly up there.
I'll have to take a ride some day.
