I just put my wife on a plane... she's off to run a marathon on the other side of the country.  That leaves me to run the house for the weekend.  It's Thursday morning and I'm trying to get the kids up and get the day going around here.  Little logistic things: clean house, money for the roofers (a remodel update is coming soon, I promise) and a situation for the dog.
All this with cats walking on me.

I'm off to poke the kids again and get them to school and me off to work.
