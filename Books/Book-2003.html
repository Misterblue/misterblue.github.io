		  As I've 
		  <a href="http://blog.misterblue.com/Books/Books02003.html#The%20Kiln%20People">said before</a>
		  ,
		  my experience has been that a book of 500 pages is a
		  sure sign that there was not a strong editor to trim the bloat.
		  This book is another example of that.
		  The pacing is poor, the style is a Grisham-esque three page
		  chapter construction and the insights into human/robot
		  interactions and relations are sophmoric.
		  Stanislaw Lem did a better job 40 years.
		  All in all, a long read and a work that would have 
		  been handled better with better writing, a more thoughtful
		  insight into the complexities of the world and
		  a deep creation of that world.

		  My past experience has been that a book of 500 pages is a
		  sign that there was not a strong editor to trim the bloat.
		  This book is an example of that.
		  The first half of this book is fantastic -- the inventiveness
		  and detail is unbelievable.  David Brin created a deeply
		  detailed and believable world for this story and he
		  pulls it off every well.  The ending peters out, though, and
		  the 500 page problem leads to 100+ pages of petering.
		  Oh, and the basic plot is a detective story but the
		  ending is a "pull a rabbit out of the hat" type solution
		  rather than any real mystery.  Sigh, a sad thing all
		  around.

        This is a fun read with good characters and the ending
        is much better than
		<a href="http://blog.misterblue.com/Books/Books-2003.html#Wicked:%20The%20Life%20and%20Times%20of%20the%20Wicked%20Witch%20of%20the%20West">
        Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West</a>
        .
        This is the Cinderalla story told by one of the ugly
        stepsisters.  Maguire builds a believable story around the
        fairy tail explaining how the father of the beautiful girl
        looses a wife, marries an "evil stepmother" and then disappears
        from the scene letting the story of  the ball play out.
        And what is "happily ever after".
        A good book.

        Normally I'd give a science fiction collection of short stories
        a 3-head rating because I really like that sort of thing.  But
        this was very disappointing.
        These editors seem to but together books on different themes
        by picking short stories from the many science fiction publications
        that specialize in that (Analog, ...).
        This collection contained stories that speculated about a world
        after people moved beyond our current fleshy container.
        The 2-head rating is not for the stories some of which are
        very creating, entertaining and well written.  This collection,
        though, is very weak with some stories only partually connected
        to the theme of  the book.  While some of the individual
        short stories are great, this collection is a hack job.
