        This is a period of time and a part of the world
        I knew nothing about.
        The Christians and the Muslims at each other's throats
        and the idealistic Europeans sticking themselves in
        the middle of it all.
        Few parallels to today, but, if you don't learn the
        first time, you are bound to repeat history.

        A dark work that is about the choices to make and the
        death that we all must deal with.
        Unlike many reviewers, I didn't have any sympathey for
        the lead character which made the ending more of a statement
        of life in general rather than a story about a man.

        A fun romp in the San Francisco of the 70's.
        I lived down in the area at that time but I didn't 
        manage to take part in the drugs or alternate lifestyle
        (I was down in the burgening Silicon Valley).
        This is a fun soap opera and, if you like interesting
        characters, this is a fun read.

      Another of the "Cat" mystery books.
      Like the

      these are entertaining.

      William Adams lead an interesting life as the first
      westerner who integrated with the Japanese society.
      His story is the basis for the book
      Shogun
      and many other books and movies.
      This book is a historians report of his time there
      and it has as much to do with the other westerners
      living in Japan as it does with William Adams.
      It is clear that the author found source material
      that has been converted almost word for word into 
      sections of this book.
      Some of the chapters were rather dry.
      But, since, I'm interested in this period
      I found some of the descriptions of how many of the
      English lived in Japan.

		  A satisfying piece of science fiction 
		  (well, actually, the purists would probably claim this 
		  is not "science fiction" since it doesn't have any science).  
		  A story about an alien who comes to earth with a 
		  plan to build a ferry boat (space ship) to ferry 
		  the last of his dying race from their planet which 
		  they have destroyed over the millennia with wars 
		  and resource depletion.  
		  This doesn't go where you think it will go and the 
		  book doesn't close with a clean closure leaving many 
		  questions to ponder.  
		  A good read.

		  I remember seeing the "cat" mysteries around my mother's 
		  house so, when I ran across a copy and some time, 
		  I decided to find out what they were all about.  
		  When younger, I enjoyed the Lord Peter Wimsey stories 
		  and these are similar in tone and content.  
		  The stories are really about the characters.  
		  You follow them through their lives as the books progress.  
		  The people are all mild, bookish sorts -- 
		  lots of librarians, teachers and clergy 
		  And there are cute, small animals -- cats in this case.  
		  All that said, the murder mysteries that underlie the 
		  real reason for the books can be rather weak and that 
		  is the case for this particular book.  
		  The solution comes quickly and unsatisfactorily 
		  in the last chapter (are there any editors in the 
		  world any more?).  
		  But the book is a fun light read and if you like mild, 
		  bookish type characters, 
		  I'm sure the whole series of "Cat" mysteries will 
		  be just you cup of tea.

		  This is a book more about the people than the events of
		  the Texas Revolution.
		  And, the people as seen by this one author, at that.
		  We spend the book in the head of Sam Houston as he waffles
		  and depresses through his stumbling, accidental generalship
		  of the Texas army.
		  The general shape of the historical facts are probably here
		  and a reader is drawn into what it must have been like to
		  live and fight in that time, but the story goes on forever
		  and Sam just doesn't rise to any level of true believability.
		  This wouldn't be my first choice for historical fictional
		  account of  the time.

		  I heard the buzz around this book so I thought I'd
		  check it out.
		  I had reactions on two levels:
		  I'm not a believer in the Rapture and other recently
		  popular mystical and magical beliefs, but I can see
		  how this book works as a powerful and moving statement
		  and call to action for people in this cult.
		  As a book reader, though, the dialog is lame
		  and the plotting is clumsy.
		  For believers, this is a 'must have'.
		  For non-believers, this will be a poorly written education.

		I thoroughly enjoyed this read.
		Like all of Gibson's books, the story is deeply connected
		to the technology, but the technology is not the point.
		The point is the world it creates and how the people
		live and react in this new world.
		This story is in the present and inhabits that
		rearified air of advertising, spies and russian mafia.
		About half way through the book, I was afraid that the
		story (with a title like "Pattern Recognition") would
		turn out like Umberto Eco's
		
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345368754/Misterblue">
		Foucault's Pendulum
		
</a>
		but this book lead to a different ending.
		But like Eco's book, this book is deeply researched --
		I learned much about Tokyo, street fashion, pilates
		and London.
		And it all was interwoven into a believable world where,
		unlike so many anti-utopian stories, is a crazy world
		where people can live and be happy.

		  My daughter gave me the Christmas present of the first of
		  Partcett's Discworld series.
		  This is the first book and it's humor is very much in the
		  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy type.  That is, very enjoyable
		  but you must take it in spoon fulls.
		  Don't read this book in one sitting.
		  Even consider reading a section a week.
		  The situations are very outlandish and low-probability events
		  are the norm.  I found reading it too quickly, lessened the effect
		  of the humor.
		  It's fun.  Don't get me wrong.  I gave it a 3.
		  But pace yourself.

		  Several academic socal commentators set out to interview Disney
		  employees, take their families to the park and then to write about
		  the social, cultural and personal impacts and experience.
		  This book is the unsatisfying result.
		  Despite the information gathering (interviews and historical research
		  the papers are not "academic" in the sense that they present
		  quantitative evidence for conclusions or observations.
		  The interviews are woven in as antecdotes the gives everything
		  a subjective feel.  The social commentary all comes from the
		  we're-all-being-turned-into-wage-slave-consumers school of throught
		  which, except for a some brief comments on people's perceptions
		  of public vs private spaces, just seems a recounting of the author's
		  previous biases.
		  The interviews were also with "front line" employees -- the people
		  running the rides and running the food courts.  I would have been
		  interested in what the "suits" think about Disney and their jobs.
		  All, in all, disappointing.
