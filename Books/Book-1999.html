      <p>He has a point (the list of laws that are getting in the way of doing
      the right thing) but I expected a description of the problem followed by
      something that could be done or maybe an analysis of the causes of suffocating
      law creation and the mechanisms that perpetuate them.&nbsp; Instead, this
      book lists one horror story after another and ends with a whinny
      "we've got 'a break free".&nbsp; After this book, I have a
      better list of examples of the problem but I don't have any tools to fix
      it or any insight into it.&nbsp; (Nov 1999)

      <p>This book is great literature.&nbsp; I'm amazed at Nobokov's command of
      the English language and this audio tape (it makes my commute easier) is
      read by Jeremy Irons who starred in the latest remake of this book.&nbsp;
      He
      is perfect.&nbsp; But the story is difficult because I bounced between
      "this is so wonderfully written" and "but she's only
      12".&nbsp; The story describes a man's deep passions in ways not
      usually done in most writings.&nbsp; But the object of his imaginings and
      passions is the 12 year old girl, Lolita.&nbsp; A "girl-child".&nbsp;
      But, as happens in all situations like this, the "girl" is
      really more of a "child" and can not live up to the older man's
      expectations.&nbsp; The writing is transcendent but the story is painful
      and tragic. (Nov 1999)</p>

      <p>I picked this up because it was small.&nbsp; It's a story of a holy man
      who lives in a hermitage on a mountain and who is taking the person he's
      training to be his replacement on a journey to the man who was his
      teacher.&nbsp; The wonderful part of this story is the character of the
      holy man.&nbsp; I really felt the different outlook on the world and the
      different approach to life.&nbsp; This book made me look at the world
      differently. (Oct 1999)</p>

      Huxley</a>
      <p>After reading several contemporary works, this was a refreshing return to
      "old fashioned" writing where the reader needs some knowledge of
      history and literary stories with a touch of Latin and French to catch the
      references that the author creates around the story.&nbsp; The story is
      about the clash of traditional culture with the nouveau rich in Los
      Angeles in 1938.&nbsp; There is opulent and arbitrary riches alongside
      great poverty. (Oct 1999)</p>

      <p>A even toned story of a Japanese young man recovering from an illness
      in the families beach cabin during world war II.&nbsp; The
      "samurai" of the title is actually the old man who tends the
      families cabin and the story is about the young man's relationship with
      this housekeeper and the housekeeper's old love who is a leper in a village near the
      cabin.&nbsp; The story is about long term relationships and their quiet
      strength set against the transient ness of the far away world at
      war.&nbsp; A comfortable read but it could have been set in New England
      for all of the local detail. (Aug 1999)</p>

      Frazier</a>
      <p>This much hyped best seller was given to me for Christmas and I loved
      the first few chapters.&nbsp; The book opens in a civil war hospital and
      the narration is in the head of the fellow recovering from wounds.&nbsp; I
      loved the beginning tone and prose.&nbsp; It truly captured that voice
      that goes on in one's head -- what one notices and what one thinks.&nbsp;
      The male protagonist leaves the hospital and we shift to the female protagonist
      back on the farm on Cold Mountain.&nbsp; Her situation is odd since she
      lead a rather protected childhood and is now in charge of the farm.&nbsp;
      Then the story gets odder and odder.&nbsp; The lady takes up with this
      quiet, sullen woman who knows all of the ways of&nbsp; plants and animals
      and the fellow runs across murderous priests and even a witches
      coven.&nbsp; Really odd stuff that, for me, really left me wondering if I
      wanted to finish the book or not.&nbsp; A quick, obtuse happy ending and
      the oddness comes to an end.&nbsp; I did not enjoy this book nearly as
      much as it's popularity promised. (Aug 1999)</p>

      S. Golden</a>
      <p>I've always been interested in Japanese history and culture and read
      this book to get a look into the world of the Geisha.&nbsp; The story is
      set just before and during World War II just as the Geisha culture and
      system was winding down.&nbsp; The book follows the life of a high class
      geisha (real geisha were hostesses and sex had very little to do with
      it).&nbsp; A girl comes from a small country village, enters a house of
      geishas in training and rises to be one of the elite.&nbsp; The tone of
      the book is understated and even with few ups and downs.&nbsp; The story
      is interested and gives a view of becoming a geisha from the girl's point
      of view. (July 1999)</p>
