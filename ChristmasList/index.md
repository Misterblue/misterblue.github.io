# Robert's Christmas List -- 2015

Any kindle book from my Amazon wish lists.
I'd prefer the audio book version as it makes my commute entertaining.

* [History]
* [Science Fiction]
* [Non-Fiction]
* [Fiction]

[Amazon gift cards] (for buying more books)

Dining gift cards (for dinners out at interesting restaurants)

Google Cardboard viewer with head straps. Similar to the [VR ShineCon]
or listed in one of the many [VR headset reviews].
Ideal would have width and depth lense adjustments.

I like sweet liquors like B&B or Drambuie.
