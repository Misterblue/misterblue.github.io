# Virtual World Exploration

Between 2006 and 2012, I was active with [SecondLife] communities
associated with the place I live.
The [21st Avenue] and [Portland Connection] simulators supported
locals who partied in the virtual world and in real life.

The above links will come into existance over time.

One thing I played with in [SecondLife] was the creation of videos
of events. I've uploaded them to [YouTube] and here is an
[index and description] of them.
