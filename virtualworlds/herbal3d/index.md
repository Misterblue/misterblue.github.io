# Herbal3D: Infrastructure for Virtual Worlds

Goals:

* Open source
* Secure

# Background

One impetus for creating Herbal3D is the creation of a follow-on
to [OpenSimulator].

OpenSimulator was originally designed as a open source alternative to [SecondLife].
But that was 10 years ago.
In that time, software development workflow has changed the tools and workflow have
changed and in general the whole solution for scalability and a massively parallel
programming has changed greatly.

OpenSimulator, since it is 10 years old, is suffering from old age.
It's a centralized service that is broken into regions and thus has scaling problems.
There have been several efforts to make open simulator decentralized and to make it
more scalable in all of its dimensions (like physics and scripting) but, again, the
software is getting long-in-the-tooth and needs updating.

So one of the things Herbal3D is attempting to do is to be an open source alternative
to the many proprietary systems that are being developed for virtual reality
and virtual worlds.
The other solutions are not wrong. They are just not open.

As an open source solution, Herbal3D is attempting to be the basis for building
scalable systems.
It is a basis for building virtual worlds infrastructure like OpenSimulator
but using newer technologies and newer design patterns
