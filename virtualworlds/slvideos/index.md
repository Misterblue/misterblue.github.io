# SecondLife Videos

While playing in [SecondLife] back in 2007  through 2012,
I made videos of some of the gatherings
in the [21st Avenue] and [Portland Connection] sims.
I found these lying around on my disk and I figured they
would be better enjoyed if they were published on the web.

Some of these videos are only 320 resolution.
I've misplaced the original source videos and, in 2007, a 320 resolution
video was considered reasonable because of bandwidth and file size.

      The [21st Avenue] [SecondLife] sim held a grand opening
      event on September 22, 2007.
      Several performers provided dance music.

      "The Fred Meyers Blues" for the Portland, Oregon themed location.

      This is possibly the very first time that Grif performed

      This was before he was willing to sing.
