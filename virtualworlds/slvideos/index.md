# SecondLife Videos

While playing in [SecondLife] back in 2007  through 2012,
I made videos of some of the gatherings
in the [21st Avenue] and [Portland Connection] sims.
I found these lying around on my disk and I figured they
would be better enjoyed if they were published on the web.

Some of these videos are only 320 resolution.
I've misplaced the original source videos and, in 2007, a 320 resolution
video was considered reasonable because of bandwidth and file size.

      Another performer at the 21st Avenue grand opening

      was
      <a href="http://music.sonicviz.com/">Komuso Tokogawa</a>
      who performed his personal version of "Amazing Grace".
      Like Grif, he is still

      <h3>Grif Bamaisin performs, December 28, 2007</h3>
      This is possibly the very first time that Grif performed
      in
      <a href="http://secondlife.com/">SecondLife</a>.
      This was before he was willing to sing.
