# SecondLife Videos

While playing in [SecondLife] back in 2007  through 2012,
I made videos of some of the gatherings
in the [21st Avenue] and [Portland Connection] sims.
I found these lying around on my disk and I figured they
would be better enjoyed if they were published on the web.

Some of these videos are only 320 resolution.
I've misplaced the original source videos and, in 2007, a 320 resolution
video was considered reasonable because of bandwidth and file size.
